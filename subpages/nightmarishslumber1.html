</head><body class="c5 doc-content"><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Have you ever made any coffee?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Oh no! I&rsquo;ve never made it myself. Of course, I&rsquo;ve had it, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">They both sat outside the large tent situated beside them. It was a midwinter&rsquo;s midnight, and the snow fell heavily. They sank into the snowy firth ground. Near to them, the sound of the ocean was heard. Dr. Dresteur made coffee for both of them. They were very much fatigued all throughout the day. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drink too quickly,&rdquo; he said to Count Rellene as he gave him a bowl of hot coffee. Count Rellene, wearing a large, black cape, with a great upturned collar. Upon him, as a belt sitting awkwardly unto his waist, he wore a thick belt, lined with bullets. His waist, with leather holsters, carried with them two large adorned short double-barreled shotguns. They were decorated with chains and charms, which brought luck and faith. The bullets were carved into with engravings of short-phrase proverbs. Besides these features, they were no ordinary bullets by any stretch. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">He drank from the bowl slowly, noting his boots covered in wilted leaves and melting snowflakes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he says.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Yes, Count Rellene.&rdquo; The Doctor served himself coffee, not looking up from the steam which danced beneath his nose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Do you ever have nightmares of any kind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Not many, no. Why do you ask.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Well, I do. I fear these visions greatly. They aren&rsquo;t ordinary nightmares. They torment me, I wake with a terrible sweat, and&hellip;and&mdash; Oh, Doctor, I may be insane, may I not be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;You may. However, they could be more than mere visions of horrid events. They could conceal some meaning,&rdquo; he said, between sips. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t think too greatly of them, Count.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">The Doctor, contrary to the count, had one large rifle at his side, slung over his shoulder. He wore a brumal winter coat, navy in pigment. As opposed to bullets (which he rathered to carry on belts tied around his thigh), he carried syringes and little swinging bottles of medicines on chains. To him, those must be his charms, thought Rellene. The charms of a Doctor, peculiar in nature, and quite grim. Rellene smiled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued the Doctor, &ldquo;remind yourself of what is true and eternal always, and do not stray away from this. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll only be lost in a deep, slumbering forest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;You say; &lsquo;slumbering&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;In constant sleep, the privation of all which is awake and knowing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Sleep; the unknowing,&rdquo; says Rellene blankly, as though assimilating what the Doctor has said to him. He drank from his coffee. Drops clung onto his large mustache, and wet clumps of hair drooped heavily. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo; The Doctor went into the large tent, leaving Rellene out in the wet snowy weather. The wind had picked up in strength. Rellene thought deeply, though there was not much to truly think about. Any attempt at forming a thought was barred by the wretched sounds surrounding him. His ears perked up at any whistle or rustle. He could not think clearly, though he&rsquo;d have thought it quite the time to do so. He downed the rest of the coffee, letting the bowl rest neatly into a nestle of leaves and snow. Think, he could not; but he did feel a strong feeling. As though he were being held upon strings which he could not for the life of him tear off. Which moved him one, then the other. His next movement, his next decision, uncertain, guided by strings. Fate, he could put it. Oh, but that fate he despised, he truly did. He nodded to himself in silence as the feeling passed his mind. He took two sticks and some leaves from a dappled, wet pile nearest him. He tied both sticks together into a cross, planting it into the snow, before descending down the firth, down the slope of snow, nearer the wind and nearer the trees; nearer the sea, he slipped into the tent. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Inside he saw the wet puddling glow of flame. The smell of incense; he smelled the smell of smoky incense fill the room, and the flickering flames limn his and the Doctor&rsquo;s figures in its washing, purifying orange hue, which reminded him of a deep red-orange soil, the colors of autumn, with its leaves. Their shadows were cast like awful dancing monsters as the light wavered. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Count Rellene,&rdquo; whispered the Doctor. He had on a peculiar pair of rectangle glasses, which gleamed, with a secondary singular eyeglass apparatus over it. To grant greater magnification, thought Rellene; it seemed most plausible. The Doctor pulled the eyeglass up over his brow. &ldquo;Count,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave it outside. You must be at all times awake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">He was right. He stepped out into the biting weather. He had left a large silver scythe out in the snow. He noted it from below as he slogged up the snow. The moonlight was overcast with clouds, though the scythe seemed to be in such a position that it reflected a single ray which fell upon it. It was a large scythe, and heavy too. Two-handing it, he had it slung over his shoulder, the great wide black blade winking with light. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Watching his step with care, he noted the movement of bushes and the lower growth. He readied his step, looking out. He held the scythe careful in hand, his gloves tightly wrapped over the steel. Eyes of colors poked out through the dark veil of night and snow. From the pall of indigo, the horned figure tore through the haze and fog, a large creature of several limbs, mismatched. It bore no resemblance to anything other than what was simply a beast of sin. Blood hung onto its fur and exposed skin like loose clothing, thick and red, clumped together. There was no other defining feature than these.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Count Rellene took up a strong stance, the scythe before him. Before the beast could make naught a movement or prance, he slung the scythe backward, catching onto a leather strap, and the scythe hung upon his back, the blade just lightly grazing the snow beneath him. He took both shotguns quickly, as they charmed and jingled in bell songs of yuletide. He shot with both, and the sound of the bullets, which too exploded upon impact, creating a dashing display of flesh and blood, echoed and resounded into the large forest upon the firth, out into the merciless nightly sea. The beast was largely determined to continue forward, as it did not fall back. The Count and the Beast moved along each other in what was a waltz, where the Count, in a flurry of motion, in such a blur of gleaming light, pulled onto the handle of the Scythe, casting it forward in a divine and swift swing. The blade cut into the chest of the beast, marking it. In an elegant pass of mist, the Beast fell into the ground. The Count, Rellene, was marked in blood&mdash; his hands wet with the burning blood. He walked toward the creature, kneeling near it. He, laying the scythe beside it, looked at the creature. He did not look long. There were other matters. The crescent moon began to wander further, and the snow ceased in a quiet. The song of winter played as he walked back toward the great tent. The song of charms and bells, playing from his guns which had been washed and purified in blood. The charms whisked and waltzed and breathed, in the song of northern stars, the song of sweet slumber, the song of love and life. He, with his scythe hung upon his back, brought his hands to his mouth, breathing. He could see his breath in the winter. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;There was another,&rdquo; said Rellene, entering the tent. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Lay him down against that bed over there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Once he had laid it, he sat near the flames to warm himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">He looked around, finding a timid, shadowed corner to sit. The Count sat in silence, his knees tucked. He was feeling wide-eyed, as his gaze rested on the tent&rsquo;s interior. The tent, though large, and made for &nbsp;what were the Doctor&rsquo;s experiments and studies, seemed to resemble something more homely. It was not sterile at all. It was adorned with a myriad of beautiful ornaments, traditional figures and swinging icons and amulets. It was much less like a Doctor&rsquo;s traveling tent, and more like a gypsy tent, with its smoky atmosphere which poured from cups and kettles, and its wonderfully superstitious air which poured in through the mystical tent&rsquo;s cloth and the airy snow which swirled to and fro from outside. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Count.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c3">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">The Doctor held up a pipe of tobacco, with large puffs of smoke billowing from his pale lips, largely obscured by his large mustache and full beard. The smoke was a ghostly mist which covered his visage. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Can you come here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Rellene stood up, looming behind the Doctor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Yes, Doctor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;You see this here?&rdquo; He pointed down the barrel of the microscope, through which, after Rellene gazed deeply down its view, noted the miniature movements of what appeared to be stains of some sort. Small cells.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I ask. I took a small blood sample of one of the past creatures we had gotten, and I am noting peculiar similarities in their cellular structure. Which, of course&hellip;&rdquo; he leaned back in his chair, reaching for a short knife on a dresser behind him. &ldquo;...this is to be expected, as they have similar physiognomic structures, albeit with some variations in the way they are ordered. Subspecies, I&rsquo;d wager&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;So what we&rsquo;ve imagined, then. They are all the same.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They </span><span class="c1 c2">originate</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;from some source, which granted them these similarities that we see. However, whether by mutation, or purposeful genetic variation through selection, that does not matter, as it does allow us to glean one grand thing: There is on original blood-source&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Lilith.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the name we give it. If we are to refer to it any longer, then it must have at the very least a name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Yes, I do agree. But then, I came to ask of you one more thing&hellip;&rdquo; The Doctor stood up, heading outward, holding the tent&rsquo;s opening open. He looked outward, then above. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot like before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">The warm smoke and glowing ashes flew up the sea&rsquo;s breeze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the Doctor, with the pipe firm between his teeth, smiling. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Rellene stood beside the Doctor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The night has not changed. Nor the moon since those midwinter nights. It hasn&rsquo;t even blinked,&rdquo; he continued. He blew smoke, &ldquo;and the snow has the same touch. It&rsquo;s exactly how we&rsquo;d left it. Down to the way it melts on your nose; to the way it melted on </span><span class="c1 c2">your </span><span class="c3 c1">nose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; replied Dresteur, looking at him puzzled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;The moon doesn&rsquo;t feel the same way it did then. Nor do I. Everything&rsquo;s changed since then. Though the moon silently remains&hellip; we can&#39;t deny that change. The moon&rsquo;s touch doesn&rsquo;t feel the same. It&rsquo;s not touching the same skin it did then&mdash; or the same person it did then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Dr. Dresteur smiled looking at Rellene. &ldquo;Do you know what day it is?&rdquo; He had a big grin on his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Christmas.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I know.&rdquo; The stars blinked. The constellations had moved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;And I got you a gift.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">The next morning was like none other, he thought. Rellene went out to feel his face against the wind. Against the biting air which tugged at his nose, he could feel his nose redden. His nose was runny. The sensation of the winter winds, embracing one another in a snowy tussle, where the snowflakes spun and swirled as though mimicking audience. The sensation was reminiscent of things past. The balustrades of winter flora which ornamented the paths of shoveled snow (they had shoveled the path in order to make clear the route to the Great tent). The hanging chandeliers of torn and wicked leaves hung from the wood of great trees. Towering up above, the trees covered the bright blue sky of December. He could just imagine her, like the wind, dancing around him&mdash; he could just hardly feel himself swayed, too. Her dress adorned with jewels which scintillated as the snowflakes. Her roseate, airy scent, which made him think of the bright blue sky. No clouds were strewn across the expanse; all was clear. It had all been in lost time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">He caught himself in helpless reverie, bringing himself back to the present before the snow against the Tent.</span></p></body></html>
