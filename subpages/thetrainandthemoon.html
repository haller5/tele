The dark had fallen over the sky, and the night was dressed in stars. The moon hung loosely, low upon the horizon, beneath the clouds which had strewn themselves thinly along the violet veil of midnight air. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; it looks like it.&rdquo; He gathered himself, as he began to feel his nose tip into a fragrant dream. He fixed his glasses. They were worn down. The glass was scratched and some parts of the thin, bronze browline rim were very subtly bent in curious ways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He put his glasses on. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t strike me as one to enjoy the night, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t say I stay up late to watch the moon.&rdquo; He drank milk from a silver chalice. Milk hung on his matured moustache. &ldquo;Regardless, how have your patients been?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The patients?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mhm&hellip; they have done well. I&rsquo;ve run into few difficulties, if any.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The moustached-man yawned loudly. &ldquo;I will head over to bed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll see you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He saw the man disappear into the thin veil of shadow which enveloped the dormitory train cars. Only the slight flicker of a candlelight could hardly be seen to spill against the wooden floors through the gap beneath the doors. The nocturnal spill of winter wind threw itself against the train&rsquo;s window, whistling with the train. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I must be getting to bed soon myself, then.&rdquo; He heaved himself up and about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He laid himself bare in bed. He felt that tonight was clear. It had never seemed so clear to him. The waters were crystalline. He saw symbols and truths where he&rsquo;d otherwise recall illusory and devilish, haunting feelings. He questioned how true this assessment was. Had the water never been so crystalline? What was different today, he wondered. Had he, only in retrospect, imagined that the blood of his thoughts which flowed from one day to the next been so muddy? Had it not, in reality, </span><span class="c3 c5">always</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;been this clear. Had he not </span><span class="c3 c5">always </span><span class="c0">known it had been this clear. Had he never stopped to see the reflectiveness of his thoughts, how clearly he saw through them. What had made him imagine their opaqueness? Was such sentiment today&mdash; that he had no clarity yestereve&mdash; not evidence that his truly muddy thoughts haunted him today and not the day before? That devilish instruments drove him mad tonight, whispered in his ears, made him believe that he saw things tonight as though he had never seen them. As though he had never tasted its clearness. He swung as a child between this clarity and muddiness of water. He wondered, though not long. He concluded he simply had no care for the matter and fell fast asleep. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
