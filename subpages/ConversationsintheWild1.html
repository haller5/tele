Their horses trotted, caparisoned in silver jewels and leather adornments. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It will snow.&rdquo; He saw through his hat the blearing Sun illuminating his face with a soft tawny glow. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only autumn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">They rode further down the valley, following the balustrades of flowers beside them. They were scarce and sparsely grouped. On the edges of their sight they could see tall, great gnarled trees wrapping around the fields, in a cool wintry embrace. The wind was more frigid than before. Clouds were more tightly looming overhead in the nightfall&rsquo;s gloom. The grass had lost its colour and the air was spectral and the winds were haunting, soughing amidst the far, far, far trees, whose bark had begun to decay and whose branches wilted in anticipation of that wintry sea of snow. Leaves gathered at their ends. The landscape had, to them, a cooler feeling. Though the blurry sight of the Sun peered its flames along the further hills, the sky above them had begun to fall into a slumberous indigo, with its brimming stars like spots of milk. The moon was full and a garish white that night.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Stopping at a short clearing, surrounded by stout trees extending upward and inward, forming a taut ceiling of interwoven branches, they settled in the soft marsh. The surrounding area was waterlogged as well, the trees&rsquo; bark was wet and the leaves above, though few, were wet with small, opalescent droplets. The branches were thick with thorns&mdash; the branches were many, with few gaps through which pale rods of moonlight fell lightly upon the verdant grass. Wanly lit columns of dust danced and swirled down along the moonlight, through the countless small narrow gaps between the branches. Amidst them, they were paired with early snowflakes, very small in size. The men let their horses rest, lit a fire and watched the milk-dropped night sky wander west through the branches. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This clearing looks very nice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He looked up. Keeping his gaze up, he reached into his coat, pulling out a box of cigarettes. &ldquo;It does,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But look too long and you&rsquo;ll get an awfully dizzying feeling.&rdquo; He blinked away snowflakes which touched lightly to his eyelashes. The end of his nose was cold and mottled in red. He turned to the others,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Any?&rdquo; He showed the box.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">One of them took one. The other declined. They raised the cigarette to the small fire, lighting its end. Cigarette in mouth, the smoke billowed upward through the air, and cast a sharp glow to their darkly visages. From distantly outside, hidden beneath the far, far trees, the small clearing of short, closely-knit trees seemed ever smaller. The burning glow of the fire shone through the dewy trees, and the thin lines of smoke poked through above, breathing into the autumn wind. Fire burned there. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He placed the box back into his coat. He took off his coat and laid it out beneath him. It was damp against the marshy soil. He lay down against it, facing upward, catching a glance of crows flying above, in black silhouettes and, gazing up, his nose cold, he raised his hand to his cheek. He felt the hair against his face. Looking over to the others beside him&mdash; he saw as they watched outward in separate directions, sitting with their knees tucked against their chest. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The one further away blew smoke. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep soon as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Karl broke through the wintry wind early morning, the cold grasping at his arms. He had not his coat on, which he had hung onto the tree branches above, swinging in light, lilting motion with the rhythm of the air. He wore only his collared shirt, his suspenders torn. His boots ran deep into the marsh, muddied and dirty, cast in a thick layer of light brown soil. Stepping out of the tent of trees he took a long glance out toward the ends of the valley, where dots of trees, painted along the dry hills, swung and their leaves rustled distantly. It was empty. He saw no animal, nor not many plants peek out through the tall grass. Standing from where he was, things seemed far. The trees appeared a slight too far to ever reach. The distance and breadth of the valley gave him a nauseous feeling. He stuck a cigarette into his mouth. He left it unlit. He stood there a long while before leaning back on the trees and sitting on the ground with his knees tucked. His arms positioned behind him. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Along the damp soil he felt metal. Turning, he took it in his hands, bringing it up toward his eye. Quiet silvery metal glinted in the early sunlight. The timid beams of glowing sunlight landed onto the silver coin in his hand. He&rsquo;d always find spare coins around, and he&#39;d always tell himself it was his grandfather who left them behind. Where he found one, he felt he was where he should be. He was always where he should be. He always found coins. He put his hand into his pocket, along with the silver. He felt it along, the ridges and the surface, as he saw outward toward what lay around the tent of trees. Nothing. He could hear nothing, see nothing, smell nothing. But he felt the quiet touch of cold silver on his fingertips. He lit the cigarette and stepped inside. The others were asleep and he made no noise.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Later that morning it rained. At first they had not noticed the spitter spatter of the ugly weather, though the clouds were certainly in a rather unhappy gloom. No, it was rather the dew gathering on the bark and fallen leaves that had told them. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If it begins to rain any harder, it&rsquo;ll be much more difficult to continue further,&rdquo; said Cosme. He had put on his grey, woollen field cap, firm upon his crown. He furrowed his brow, looking past the men at the sparkling, splinterings of rain which filled the valley past their small tent of trees. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go. Quickly,&rdquo; said Karl. Cosme and the other&mdash; Edel&mdash; followed. They were out in the rain from then forward. Edel turned to see the trees, gnarled into place, in a tightened embrace, before falling back into step. The sun that morning held along the ends of the hills in the distance, hiding behind clouds. The clouds too appeared to be hiding. They were lined in dark, and a heavy, thin veil of darkly winds hugged them. The rain was still light. Their horses beside them trotted at an awkward speed. It was a while before they rode them out. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Out against the grass, there was not much for a great stretch. When evening fell they let their feet lay again on soil, and let the horses sleep. Edel wrote in his journal.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Winter of 1928. Travelling. Roads are no longer here, only great valleys and clouds. We may need to stop for food.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He wrote nothing more. They slept. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The next morning they trotted along. They had a great breakfast, as they anticipated a stop soon. Some town must be nearby, they thought. They had bread with butter and mangoes. And milk. The milk still runs wet on the ends of their facial hair. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Before they had left, while eating their breakfast they spoke.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How long do you think before we reach a town?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve asked five times.&rdquo; Klaus wiped his mouth with his cap. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, this food isn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; do us much good for too long.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo; He turned to him, &ldquo;go check further up ahead for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Cosme finished his food and stood up. He left soon thereafter.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I bet you heretofore we&rsquo;ll have some luck,&rdquo; said Edel between bites.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">They saw Cosme disappear amongst some dense lake of fog and trees ahead.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Reckon he&rsquo;ll find much?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been going real long.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">They finished their food.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he started. &ldquo;What&hellip; uhm, Edel, what do you write in your journal?&rdquo; He began packing the lunch.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not much. Just dates and thoughts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t do much writing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You pull it out an awful lot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I draw quite a bit. Or, sketch, that is. I sketch in it, stuff we see, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; He got on his horse.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing; it just wondered. Had a grandfather who wrote a great deal in his journal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What things?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No idea. He was a general in the Revolution.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">They got on their horses and went forward. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your grandfather was in the Revolution?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t too long ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, it wasn&#39;t. He was old when he joined. Only general &lsquo;cause it was all guerillas and shit. Had no experience, just a writer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And he became general?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know, when people get famous for writing ideology and whatnot, they get themselves in power. You must know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suppose, yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, he got himself in a load of issues, burning down plantations and all that. Not many of those up and going now, thanks to him and others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I knew a couple from the war. All older folk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He ended up hanging himself sometime ago, when my father was still a young father, when I was real, real young. A baby. The war was still going&mdash;&rdquo; He turned over to Edel. &ldquo;At its peak, you see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mmm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He burned with the plantation. Nobody was there with him&mdash; must&rsquo;ve done it himself, must&rsquo;ve known. My father didn&rsquo;t find out until months later, and my grandmother&hellip; she was in despair at the news, too. She&rsquo;s fallen ill since then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Since then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; what is that, some&hellip; my age ago. Twenty six years ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How old was he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Forty four.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And your grandmother&rsquo;s been ill for twenty six years?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, she doesn&#39;t talk much. Never heard her speak myself, and she doesn&rsquo;t like me much. Doesn&rsquo;t look me in the eye, never. Frail woman, she never was there. Always wallowed in despair, too. Those psychologists say she&#39;s insane. They feel a need to lock her up in some sanatorium, that place where they got them like prisoners.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard it like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? The sanatoriums? Awful. We didn&rsquo;t let them take her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They could treat her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Maybe. But we couldn&rsquo;t let her go. She&rsquo;s somewhat treated at home. Miracle she hasn&rsquo;t killed herself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The fog closed in a little closer, and the air felt much cooler and more fresh. More frozen and still. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It seemed to them as though they were the wind running through. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s up ahead,&rdquo; said Edel.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; called Cosme. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something up over here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
