It is not that he lacked any major framework, he certainly laid a great foundation, but&mdash; if his name be mentioned at all in Politics&mdash; it is beside the twentieth century giant which is Marx&mdash; or more broadly, the Young Hegelians. (I won&rsquo;t go any further on the Young Hegelians, other than to lightly motion at them as the primary political marker on history that we may think of if we ever pair </span><span class="c0 c3">Hegel</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c3">Politics</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in common discourse.)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;So, if Marx turned Hegel&rsquo;s dialectic &ldquo;right side up,&rdquo; it really </span><span class="c0 c3">begs</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the question of how Hegel was handled by the Right Wing&mdash; that is, the other end of the spectrum to Marx. Reasonably enough, we must first begin with understanding what the </span><span class="c0 c3">Left </span><span class="c0">and </span><span class="c0 c3">Right</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;wing even are, for if we simply throw these terms around without understanding them, we will really get nowhere. The Left wing is easy enough to define for our purposes, as we will generally line it up with the revolutionary fervour of the French Revolution, a tossing aside of the order of things. It is essential to the left wing that class distinctions be tossed out&mdash; in other words, capitalism&mdash; just as the French had properly disposed of feudalism. In fact, the seedlings of anarchist and socialist thought were beginning to form </span><span class="c0 c3">here</span><span class="c0">. If this was the Left wing, then, we can see the Right Wing as the reactionary, those who sought to try to maintain an old order of things. However, as time went on, the Right took on a more </span><span class="c0 c3">quasi-revolutionary</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;nature&mdash; which, as we will see, are borrowed from Hegel&rsquo;s historicism of dynamism&mdash; as it heralded ideas previously known within the Left Wing, like nationalism and the like, which will be central to our genealogy. It is here where we land at a very, extremely broad outline of the two ends. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So if Hegel was, as we know, a man who had a nuanced relationship with the French revolutionary fervour, praising its heralding of reason and the seeing it as larger revealing of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Idea</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;which, similar to Marx&rsquo;s teleology of </span><span class="c0 c3">communism</span><span class="c0">, was central to his ideas of his Reason, then </span><span class="c0 c3">how </span><span class="c1 c0">was he in any way appealing to the reactionary, and somewhat anti-Revolutionary philosopher? For this, we begin with Taine.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Taine, for all his greatness, had one primary motivating flaw which contributed to his later obscurity. From Taine we can see the earliest major forms of modern anti French Revolutionary thought&mdash; in </span><span class="c0 c3">The French Right</span><span class="c1 c0">, J.S. McClelland introduces Taine briefly, </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1 c4 c6">&ldquo;Taine is on the edge. He is an irrationalist, but not an anti-rationalist. He recognizes the value of reason, but also sees its limitations.&rdquo; (p. 23). McClelland, J. S., and John Frears. The French Right: (From De Maistre to Maurras). Cape, 1970. </span></p><p class="c2 c5 c9"><span class="c1 c4 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Now, hold onto this little epitaph of sorts, as we turn to Hegel. Hegel, veered from the sense of reason and man found in the Revolution. He focused heavily on history&mdash; broadly, he considered all human activity to be the sum of history, or defined by their history. As such, to understand the character of an epoch, a people, you must understand and acknowledge its history. This is the first break from the French Left radicalist view of people as a sum of their interactions&mdash; the </span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">famous </span><span class="c0 c3">tabula rasa</span><span class="c0">. In this manner, Hegel had already begun a theory of societies which was based on its history, rejecting an idea of a </span><span class="c0 c3">blank slate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;individualistic, or atomistic theory of person. To Hegel, his Reason was something grasped by a continuation of history and becoming, not by individuals. The primary point of his philosophy of history was, however, its tendency toward a teleology based upon the </span><span class="c0 c3">Geist</span><span class="c0">, which guided toward a process of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Idea</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(his Reason) revealing itself through the process. To Hegel, the guiding force&mdash; </span><span class="c0 c3">Geist</span><span class="c0">&mdash; served to move the revelation of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Idea</span><span class="c1 c0">&mdash; through the becoming. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">In Hegel&rsquo;s Lectures on the Philosophy of History, delivered in the University of Berlin, he said, </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4 c6">&ldquo;[it is] our belief, that Reason governs the world, and has consequently governed its history.&rdquo; (Introduction, Section III Philosophical History, p. 26) Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, 1770-1831, and John Sibree. Lectures On the Philosophy of History. London: G. Bell and sons, 1881. </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c4 c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thus, we turn back to Taine and his hostility toward rationality. Taine&rsquo;s hostility toward reason drew him to a distinction of two </span><span class="c0 c3">reasons</span><span class="c0">, which he called the </span><span class="c0 c3">raison </span><span class="c0 c3">raisonnante</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c0 c3">raison qui s&rsquo;ignore</span><span class="c0">. The first reason is our most familiar </span><span class="c0 c3">reason</span><span class="c0 c1">, that which operates according to logic and seeks to be as refined as mathematical models. The second, however, is not reason at all in the way we understand&mdash; McClelland again offers us a valuable insight into its nature, </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The </span><span class="c4 c3">raison qui s&rsquo;ignore</span><span class="c1 c4 c6">&nbsp;is not reason at all in the first sense, at least not in Taine or Burke. It refers to wisdom, the accumulated wisdom of the ages which is slowly deposited in institutions. The philosopher has access to it, but the method of access differs from the method used in the first kind of reasoning in that it does not involve deduction from premises but an empathetic research into history, geography, literature and myth. The forces with which the philosopher may have to deal if he is to find out what it is may be unconscious.&rdquo; (p. 23). McClelland, J. S., and John Frears. The French Right: (From De Maistre to Maurras). Cape, 1970. </span></p><p class="c7 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">This bears a striking resemblance to our Hegelian philosophy of history, his </span><span class="c0 c3">raison qui s&rsquo;ignore</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;appears to be quite similar to Hegel&rsquo;s understanding of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Idea</span><span class="c1 c0">. Taine&rsquo;s relationship to Hegel is of no surprise, as he, very early on, showed an attraction toward Hegel&rsquo;s metaphysics. He only disdained its approach to rationalism. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In Maurice Barres&rsquo; novel </span><span class="c0 c3">Les Deracines</span><span class="c0">, a major theme permeates the entirety&mdash; to Barres, there is no self-deduced system of relationships like morality or the State or society. There is no conscious rationality which arrives at these, like Taine&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c3">raison raisonnante</span><span class="c0">. To Barres, such is absurd. For him, these are the result of a certain kind of determinism which he labels </span><span class="c0 c3">nationalism</span><span class="c0">. And to him, nationalism is the </span><span class="c0 c3">raison qui s&rsquo;ignore</span><span class="c0">. Or, more precisely, the myth of nationalism, which I&rsquo;ll return to. Barres&rsquo; determinism, guided by his formulation of the </span><span class="c0 c3">raison qui s&rsquo;ignore</span><span class="c1 c0">, arrives at how the history of a nation informs its present circumstances. Barres then gives us the very radical notion that all systems can be only properly found in the history of a people, and not be self-deduced through some logic or rationality, as the French revolutionaries attempted, when they organised the State and society. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Back to understanding this new conception of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Idea</span><span class="c0">, and the </span><span class="c0 c3">Geist</span><span class="c0">, and such, we ask what exactly </span><span class="c0 c3">is it</span><span class="c0">, in this new framework, with and to what does it lead if not Hegel&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c3">Idea</span><span class="c0">, in its precise sense? We return to Marx; I made the rather controversial connection that Marx&rsquo;s assertion that communism is a logical unfolding of the contradictions of capitalism&mdash; and thus that the contradictions of capitalism are explained through their roles in the advent of communism&mdash; and is a teleology similar to that of Hegel&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c3">Geist</span><span class="c0">. Though admittedly dubious, in </span><span class="c0 c3">Marx and Teleology</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;by Sean Sayer, he notes, </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;According to Althusser, these Hegelian formulae [present in the </span><span class="c4 c3">Grundrisse Notebook I, page 158, Marx, Karl. Grundrisse: Foundations of the Critique of Political Economy. Penguin Books, 1973.</span><span class="c4">] and Marx&rsquo;s humanism are unavoidably teleological. They are cases of what Althusser calls the philosophy of &ldquo;origin and end,&rdquo; for they presume the notion of a &ldquo;subject&rdquo; present at the outset and continuing through- out, which embodies the end. The process of development is then the realization of an end that has been operative in the subject from the beginning.&rdquo; (p. 46) Sayers, Sean. &ldquo;Marx and teleology.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c3">Science &amp; Society: A Journal of Marxist Thought and Analysis</span><span class="c1 c4 c6">, vol. 83, no. 1, Jan. 2019, pp. 37&ndash;63, https://doi.org/10.1521/siso.2019.83.1.37.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The purpose of this comparison is that it&rsquo;ll explain how Sorel, by reorienting this notion of the &ldquo;subject&rdquo;, was driven to his </span><span class="c0 c3">myth</span><span class="c0">. Sorel, a marxist, or at least intimately aligned with Marxism, felt that the </span><span class="c0 c3">myth</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;was the force which drove history forward while itself being revealed in the process of history.</span></p><p class="c7 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4 c6">&ldquo;Sorel is specific in his advocacy of myth, but in Maurras and Barr&eacute;s there is an implied use of myth. For Barr&eacute;s, the real France of the provincial graveyards is a mythology; it may not have existed in the past, but it points the way to action in the present.&rdquo; (p. 33) McClelland, J. S., and John Frears. The French Right: (From De Maistre to Maurras). Cape, 1970. </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c4 c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this way, Hegel&rsquo;s conception of societies as entities which were defined by their histories, larger than the individual interactions which made it up, and partook in a teleological relationship with some metaphysical </span><span class="c0 c3">Geist </span><span class="c0">and the </span><span class="c0 c3">Idea</span><span class="c1 c0">, was foundational in the romantic nationalism of the Action Fran&ccedil;aise and broader Far Right thinking.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Barres, in his work </span><span class="c0 c3">De Hegel aux cantines du Nord</span><span class="c1 c0">, in Chapter One, offers a pretty succinct and strong support for a genealogy of Hegel in this regard,</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It is well known that according to Hegel&rsquo;s admirable dialectic, the Idea cannot be manifested in a particular fact or individual. The Idea is immanent only in a succession of phenomena moving towards the infinite&hellip; we now know how to follow the historical development of the nations; we now understand what has gone before; and more, we respect that development&hellip; and that the truth of a thing consists in its place in the total scheme of things.&rdquo; (p. 22) Barr&egrave;s, Maurice. </span><span class="c4 c3">De Hegel Aux Cantines Du Nord</span><span class="c1 c4 c6">. E. Sansot et Cie , 1904.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For Barres, who we will label a proto-fascist, he is that primary fountain of intellect for which the fascist gets his intoxicated romantic sense of nationalism, and this revolutionary </span><span class="c0 c3">Idea</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Nation</span><span class="c0">&mdash; which truly is mere myth, it does not matter if such a France or &nbsp;Germany ever existed, only that it exists in myth and in the people. You&rsquo;ll hear fascists and fascist rhetoric follow with an idea of &ldquo;revitalising the Nation.&rdquo; Usually it comes with a deeply nostalgic sense for that old, ancient Great Nation. Such a thing does not exist, but is what guides forth. Such ideas of palingenesis are very well documented by historians of fascism; Barres writes for us in his </span><span class="c0 c3">Scenes et Doctrines du Nationalisme</span><span class="c0">, connecting his </span><span class="c0 c3">Nation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to the </span><span class="c0 c3">Idea</span><span class="c1 c0">, </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4 c6">&ldquo;Our thoughts are not the products of our own individual intelligence; they are the physiological translations of primeval physiological dispositions.&rdquo; (p. 17) Barre&#768;s, Maurice, 1862-1923. Sce&#768;nes Et Doctrines Du Nationalisme. Paris: E&#769;mile-Paul, 1902. </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">By this he means that the thoughts of the nation are themselves&mdash; through the process of history&mdash; the primeval </span><span class="c0 c3">Nation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;revealing itself in history, in the creation of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Nation</span><span class="c0">, in the creation of the people. The truth of </span><span class="c0 c3">Nation </span><span class="c0">consists in its place in the total scheme of the development of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Nation</span><span class="c0">. Immanent in the succession of history, and informing its development. Again, the </span><span class="c0 c3">Nation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the </span><span class="c0 c3">Idea</span><span class="c0">, and its </span><span class="c0 c3">Geist</span><span class="c1 c0">, its consciousness and force.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Integral to the Right Wing was the preservation of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Nation</span><span class="c0">, which, in practicality, was the status quo, or what it was </span><span class="c0 c3">mythicised</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;to be. Hegel&rsquo;s preface to the Philosophy of the Right was integral in the rationale:</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4 c6">&ldquo;What is rational is real;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4 c6">And what is real is rational.&rdquo; (p. xxvii) </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4 c6">Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, 1770-1831, and Samuel Walters Dyde. Hegel&#39;s Philosophy of Right. London: G. Bell and sons, 1896. </span></p><p class="c7 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">This is expressed in subtlety by Barres&rsquo; notion of the </span><span class="c0 c3">raison qui s&rsquo;ignore</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the </span><span class="c0 c3">real</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;ancestors, the dead.</span></p><p class="c7 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4 c6">&ldquo;After the long, hard work of foraging, after a subtle and profound search, I found the gushing source in my little garden&hellip; Thus it seems to me that the individual is bound to all his dead ancestors by the efforts and sacrifices of individuals in the past.&rdquo; (p. 11) Barre&#768;s, Maurice, 1862-1923. Sce&#768;nes Et Doctrines Du Nationalisme. Paris: E&#769;mile-Paul, 1902. </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We focused a great deal on Barres, and this is for good reason: Barres takes Hegel and plants us into a nationalism and sense of history which follows by the </span><span class="c0 c3">Nation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;into the </span><span class="c0 c3">Nation&mdash; </span><span class="c0">to him, the nebulous of </span><span class="c0 c3">France</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as an </span><span class="c0 c3">ought-to-be</span><span class="c0">, and as </span><span class="c0 c3">how it was</span><span class="c0">. Barres&rsquo; sensibilities were no obscure ideas to the French nationalists of the twentieth century, and he was a strong ideological undercurrent of his contemporary thinkers such as Charles Maurras, who later would be a significant figure of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Nouvelle Droite</span><span class="c0">. The </span><span class="c0 c3">Nouvelle Droite</span><span class="c0">, would become the fountain source of all the Far Right since then, and its ideology survives and thrives in the fringes of radicalism on the Right, the extremes, the </span><span class="c0 c3">Far</span><span class="c1 c0">. Though Hegel as a source of ideology is no longer praised nor considered, Hegel was integral to the development of the very particular doctrines of the Far Right, and Fascism. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I will finish off with Barres&rsquo; notes on Philosophy, </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;He could not have directed or annulled the conclusions of the arguments which he invented. A principle is often destined for a mysterious future.&rdquo; (p. 14) Barr&egrave;s, Maurice. </span><span class="c4 c3">De Hegel Aux Cantines Du Nord</span><span class="c4">. E.
