</head><body class="c6 doc-content"><p class="c1"><p class="c1"><span class="c3">His nose poked through the sultry air. It was late evening, which was when they had told him to arrive. The surroundings were warm and thick, verdant and heavy in growth. The trees&rsquo; branches appeared to tear off with their weight. He could feel himself having to duck only very slightly to avoid the leaves brushing up against his hair. Though it was late summer evening, the days appeared no brighter than if it were winter. Tonight, the moon hung across the sky, suspended against the array of stars. It was more vibrant than the day before. The cold shimmer of moonlight did not make the day any less hot than it was. It was late evening, and the sun was gone. Still, it was very hot. He pulled at his collar. He wore a simple pin-striped oxford shirt and grey trousers. Even just a shirt was too hot. While he had made sure to shower before his arrival, he noted&mdash; upon reaching a small pond that hit against the path (the path was not pavement but simply trampled grass)&mdash; that his hair was flat against his head and it bore an unkempt and muggy appearance. Wisps of hair appeared to peer out of all sides. He stopped at the pond for a brief moment, fixed his glasses firmly against his nose and continued. He aptly observed that the building was quite obscure, and that the forest, through which he now walked through, hid it entirely. They had asked him to arrive by foot. It was a long walk. He did not have his watch and, therefore, could not keep track of the time. But it was less dark than it was now. Or was it no longer late evening? Was it night? It&rsquo;d explain the dark. But it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be so. He had left promptly with great certainty he&#39;d arrive at a reasonable time. If it </span><span class="c3 c5">were</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;so, it&rsquo;d be incredibly embarrassing, not to mention shameful. However, he had made it thus and it&rsquo;d be even more shameful if he were to leave now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He did not imagine then, as he approached his destination, that it would be as it was. It was greatly underwhelming in scope. It wasn&rsquo;t large or tall at all. Not nearly enough to be what it claimed to be. He had envisioned a large laboratory, as that&rsquo;s what it was. A government laboratory. But it missed the mark with utter completeness. In fact, it was so strange of a building he thought for a moment he may have stumbled across what was an expressionist architectural exhibit. The building, if one could aptly call it so, was flat, very flat. In a neo-neoclassical style, it seemed highly simplified, with large pillars that supported the flat building, suspending it in the air. Each of the pillars was greco-roman in aesthetic. It gave the impression of a government institute. But if you had stripped it of any grandeur, and we&#39;re left with the ruins of a government building. The only memorable aspect to it was that it was suspended. However, it did seem as though it needed little more. The very fact that it was suspended was so peculiar in itself that he hardly kept his mind much longer on the architectural detail. He was captivated then and there when it caught his eye. How that building there was suspended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He turned around, alarmed at the voice. It was incredibly dark. The voice sounded as though it were that of a young girl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why are you dressed so formally?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He refused to elaborate any further as long as he was unaware of the voice&rsquo;s origin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The voice stopped. He reflected momentarily, wondering if it were simply in his head. He felt a tap on his shoulder. She was there. It was the girl. She was not a very young girl, but she appeared to be in school, given her apparent age. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? What are you doing?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What are </span><span class="c3 c5">you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;doing?&rdquo; she replied. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was averagely tall. From what it looked like to him, her hair was ginger. Though making out colors was presently difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re working here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; She sounded displeased with the answer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He could not give any more of an answer, as it would be in violation of the confidentiality of his potential employment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. I don&rsquo;t know. What are you doing here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I live here,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Live here?&rdquo; He noticed that she was in just a mauve shirt. He supposed that was her sleepwear. Especially so, he was reminded of how hot he felt in his wool pants. It did seem as though she lived here. &ldquo;You live </span><span class="c3 c5">here</span><span class="c0">? In this building there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He pointed at the suspended flat building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She gazed at him with disdain, before pointing at the building, though not breaking her sight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. &lsquo;In this building there.&rsquo;&rdquo; She mocked his tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t answer much for me.&rdquo; It only left him with more questions. He was asked to arrive here at late evening. And there was someone who would intercept him. But he suspected it&rsquo;d be a manager, or a supervisor, even the head of the department. It was clearly not this girl. &ldquo;Excuse me, but I need to cut this conversation short.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He approached the building further. She followed him far behind. </span></p></body></html>
