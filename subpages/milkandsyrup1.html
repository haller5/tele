</head><body class="c9 doc-content"><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air of the room was peculiar, he noticed. It was not a bad odour, not at all. Though it did carry with it a rather strange tinge, a queer smell of sweet milk and syrup. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello, Bludermann.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good afternoon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The woman was tall, with long legs in silk stockings, clearly provocatively translucent, and her skirt was too short for her height. She was taller than Bludermann. The furniture was constructed from mahogany, dark and strong. She had her large windows open, curtains like waters, flowing in the quiet summer winds.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What brought you and the office here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, uhm&hellip;&rdquo; He noticed her cross her legs then. She had these large strange paintings behind her, adorned in a golden frame&mdash; old paintings of her and her family, when she was a young girl, no more than five. &ldquo;Well, as you know we are working on&hellip; on the case. I can&rsquo;t tell you about that, I&rsquo;m&mdash;I.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She stood up and walked toward the kitchen.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asks, flustered. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Keep talking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mhm. And, as you know I can&rsquo;t tell you about the case&hellip;&rdquo; The room was wide and had a domed vault roof, where the sunlight shined through onto her seat. Her red velvet sofa. It was a soaking red, terribly pungent in taste. &ldquo;&hellip;we only needed to ask you a few questions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ask away.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He sat alone, his hands against his seat. His ears felt warm and his head rushed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ask me questions, Bludermann.&rdquo; She entered the room in more abhorrent clothing. She had not her shirt, but only the corset tight against her breasts.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He furrowed his brow, lowering his gaze. He touched his fingertips against his lap, digging against his thigh. &ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; He stood up quickly, his posture bent awkwardly. The rugs below him had a nice set of illustrations. He paid no mind.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This woman! What does she think she&rsquo;s doing? It&rsquo;s utterly hopeless to stay here any longer. I mustn&rsquo;t speak any longer with her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t leave. Please, don&rsquo;t leave. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gotten into you!&rdquo; She held his arm. &ldquo;You really can&rsquo;t leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Her body had a sultry air; of sweet milk and syrup. </span></p>
