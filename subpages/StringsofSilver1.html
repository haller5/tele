She jumped carelessly from roof to roof, upon fence unto porches, slipping delicately through shadow-snatched corridors in the wretched Earth. Her broken whiskers and dirt-ridden paws. Broken whims, she felt doleful angels on torn harps fawn at her feet, sing horrid songs which seemed to her like banishings of her soul, for they ardently swayed one way then the other in hidden notes which evaded her large ears. Can it not be, she thought, that these divine creatures of little stature followed her in confounded thought? She kicked up new leafs freshly withered off large, old antiquated trees adorned with carvings and many small flashing lights which celebrated the coming eve of Christ. She saw lights blaze deep into the dusty night and blight her weary eyes. With a blessed natural sheen, she saw the unnatural world, with dead boys and dead girls, mothers weeping in white gowns. Large, towering lamps&mdash; iron in form&mdash; of incandescent glow cast golden gleam onto their woeful figures, suffusing their pale, roseate faces in a waxy lustre and, with hopeful fervent tones of Gold radiance bathing the despairing, drowsy scene, the cat slipped into a thin corner between two large wooden homes with unkempt yards and writhing fences.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To her the world had no means of comfort or embrace. It did not feel as though she felt in any way part of it, as she knew she desired deeply in her heart more than what the world had to offer. The world&rsquo;s small offerings were much too miniscule and pathetic to her, though simultaneously the world was far too large for her, it caused her great distress. In a dizzying waltz with no other with whom she felt her heart interwoven with, she had loose silver strands of love she carried with her.</span></p></body></html>
