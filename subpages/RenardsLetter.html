</head><body class="c7 doc-content"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The snow was white. Whiter than usual. It was blindingly white. So it seemed to Renard. It seemed blindingly white, that is what it seemed. The sun reared an ugly form against the shapely white clouds which were thin against the otherwise empty, darkly glass skies. From beyond them, Renard could just catch the light glint of something just outside the skies, just out of reach. But he saw it nonetheless. Behind him, his steps followed closely behind his feet, peeling themselves into the snow as large boot footprints. The small flakes and clumps of snow caught themselves, hung tightly, onto the fabric of his boots. He walked alongside Father Craner. Craner was similarly striding along the snow, with a similar height. Wandering alongside them, flickering, was the sun fallen, falling into the further edge of the highlands. The two men walked near arm in arm, a closeness the sun could not put asunder. The sun lit up its now insignificant spot as though it were only a flame from a match. It looked as though the lightest wind, the gentlest embrace of the surrounding wintry wind, would extinguish it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh, look over there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Renard looked over. There was a large, rotting wooden signpost which stuck erect from the pure, airy snow. Snowflakes gathered at the top of the signpost, which was carved as an arrow, and had calligraphy upon it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5">St. George</span><span class="c3">, it read. Above it there were three crows. No more. Their eyes were intentful. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Saint George?&rdquo; repeated Renard. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes, Saint George. That was the name of the town, if I recall correctly&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off in thought as they approached the sign. The crows did not move. &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo; said Father Craner. &ldquo;Leave the sign alone!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">They did not move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Father, leave them. They haven&rsquo;t done anything. Not even a slight movement. Look at them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Craner watched the crows. Truly, they hardly appeared to be alive, were it not for the intentful gleam in their dark eyes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what they do or don&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;m not bothered by them, not at all.&rdquo; He looked at the crows. He took off his coat. Holding it up, he used it to ward off the crows. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re bad for crops.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The crows fluttered off through the raining snow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;The people don&rsquo;t need crows,&rdquo; he murmured discontentedly, putting on his coat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Crops? In the winter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Upon the final frost.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;When would that be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s April, so what then&hellip;? May?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I can hardly believe it, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He looked over to Renard. Renard paid him no mind, but continued walking. Or rather, he waded through the snow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That it even snows this deep into Spring.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Craner grumbled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;You think so, right? I&rsquo;ve never seen anywhere that it snows like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the mountains.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Even still,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">He looked back at Craner, who hadn&rsquo;t moved. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Still, it&rsquo;s not as though I&rsquo;ve seen snow at all, really,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Sure, I think, though I&rsquo;m not sure, I think it&rsquo;d snow when I was younger. Where I lived. With my parents, my grandmother. Only very rarely, however. And when it did, it was the lightest snow you&rsquo;d ever seen. You&rsquo;d go and make a snowman, and it&rsquo;d really be mostly dirt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Craner made a move to his coat, trying to find something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Renard stood, waiting for Craner. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Saint George&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s called,&rdquo; he muttered. He pulled out a pink envelope. &ldquo;They sent it here, see.&rdquo; He raised up to show Renard. He had a quite quaint grin on his face. &ldquo;They sent it here, take a look. Because,&rdquo; he continued, opening it and unfolding the letter. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have any good roads or signs besides this one right here.&rdquo; He vaguely gestured at the signpost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">One crow was back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Look, com&rsquo;ere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Renard walked toward him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s quite a cute letter. Written by the little girl. Her handwriting looks pretty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Renard took the letter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Father Craner&rsquo;s grin dissolved. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a look at the letter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Read it out loud, please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Renard read it out loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Dear Father Craner. I met an old man in the village who&rsquo;d told me he knew you&mdash;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall any such man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yeah. Alright,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d&rsquo; told me he knew you. I&rsquo;ve never spoken to him. But the others&mdash; the adults&mdash; they knew him. So I trust him. He gave me your address. The post passes rather infrequently, and when it does it passes at the most inconvenient of moments. It has no schedule. We have no post boxes, either. So I entrusted the old man with this letter. He, since he&rsquo;s always at home, will give it to the post man. I may be in school. If this letter to you bears any semblance of significance, please come to my village. It is really dire. And my mother. It&rsquo;s my mother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;It is really weird, is it not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Well, really there&rsquo;s no information at all. And look, do you see the very end there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; He did not notice anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Look, let me see.&rdquo; The Father ran to catch up to him. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he pointed. &ldquo;At the very end there, it seems as though there&rsquo;s another stroke. But she never continued it. She was going to write more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;More? Could have been just an accident.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;An accident, that&rsquo;s what I thought of, of course. But, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an accident.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no reason for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Renard ignored him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Craner. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it anyway. I find it strange she&rsquo;d reach out to </span><span class="c4 c5">me</span><span class="c3">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Because of the old guy. She says it right there.&rdquo; He hands the letter back to Craner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, </span><span class="c4 c5">sure</span><span class="c3">. But I&rsquo;ve no idea who this man is. I&rsquo;ve never met anybody of the country here. They&rsquo;re foreign. They hardly speak English. Only recently have they taught the little children English. I&rsquo;d have no opportunity to meet an old man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;If he moved?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Sure, that could be. But to </span><span class="c4 c5">here</span><span class="c3">?&rdquo; He gestured at the large field of snow. &ldquo;Regardless, she makes her mother out to be quite visibly sick. That&rsquo;s not a theological problem. I&rsquo;ve no matter here! I don&rsquo;t know what they need me for!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Be that as it may, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes. Yes, that&rsquo;s right. I did invite you here.&rdquo; They walked closer. &ldquo;I just thought that&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Just across from them, though still very distant, they could see the faint markings of a corn field. It was a very large corn field. The village was made of small dotted houses spreading out toward the North&mdash; right of the setting sun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the village?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d believe so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">They were both struck by the village. It was really seemingly abandoned. There was not the dot of a person in sight. It was approaching night, however&mdash; there would be no reason to be out. Still, the lamps the village seemed to have were so terribly dim that they hardly spilled from the homes&rsquo; interiors into the street, besides the faintest puddles of a flickering, incandescent light just hardly glowing from the windows. On the other hand, the sky was a nightish and full blue. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;You thought what?&rdquo; asked Renard. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be of some help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no theologian.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Right. You&rsquo;re a psychiatrist. I thought you&rsquo;d help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">They walked down the steep snowy slopes, with their boots dragging across the landscape. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">They reached the nearby stables. The horses, adorned with the specks of snow and wearing jewels of ice which clung to their fur, looked elegant in the wooden stables. They were a great array of colours. Black, brown, white. The black horses were especially beautiful. Upon their left, the little shafts of sunlight, casting quiet rays which floated above the ground, reached the corn fields. There were quaint scarecrows. There were no crows. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Not much later, as they meandered across the small village, did they find that the sun had completely sunk into the horizon. The moon was well in the sky, glowing. The stars were in complete view. They appeared to imitate the radiant snowflakes falling below, as the stars of the sky appeared like static flakes of snow in some way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Over here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;How do you know the address?&rdquo; asked Renard. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;It says on the back of the letter.&rdquo; Craner showed the letter. As he had said, there was writing on the back. A short address. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What does an address matter in a town with no roads?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There were indeed no roads. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There was little of anything. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">They met an old woman. The woman had a strange eye. It didn&rsquo;t appear to be real. Though they didn&#39;t dare ask if it were glass, lest they appear rude so soon into their visit. They did not want to make a bad impression on the locals. But still, that did not prevent Renard from observing the woman and wondering what made her so peculiar. She wore the poorest choice of clothing one could imagine. It really wasn&rsquo;t a matter of poverty, as Renard found that even the most rural places had at least a few women quite skilled in fabrics. It wasn&rsquo;t the lack of material, either. She simply must&rsquo;ve chosen to wear what really resembled nothing more than just a bag with some sleeves. The fabric was harsh, as though it were made of some hay or really thick and abrasive cotton. The woman wasn&rsquo;t particularly unattractive either. She just appeared as though she did not try. This bothered him greatly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">While her and Father Craner spoke, exchanging words, he looked at the home behind the woman. It was a small shed looking thing. Of course, it was a home. It was always a home, he thought. It did appear quite cozy, too. From where he stood, he thought he saw a cat in the house. Just through the window. It was perched awkwardly on some couch, watching television. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Over on that end, you&rsquo;ll find her, I believe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Renard had tuned into their conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Over there? Do you not know for sure? There must not be </span><span class="c4 c5">that </span><span class="c3">many people here.&rdquo; Craner questioned the woman. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;As I said, it&rsquo;s as I believe.&rdquo; She scratched her leg through her bag of a dress. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you nothing for sure, mister Father.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that. Just point the direction.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Over there, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">She pointed over to a large row of houses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Which?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That one with the dog on the fencepost.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There was a house with a dog. A sad-looking dog, with hair too long. It looked greasy, or wet. It was chained to the fencepost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Should they be having a dog chained up like that?&rdquo; asked Renard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The woman looked over to Renard with disdain. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, mister,&rdquo; she said mockingly. She pulled on a cigarette from a small pocket haphazardly sewn unto her dress. She lit it with a match, placing it between her lips. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; she said, though her words were more unintelligible as the cigarette hung from her tongue. &ldquo;They let that dog out in the day. It just can&rsquo;t be out in the night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; repeated Renard with monotone disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">He looked over at the dog. It was sad&mdash; at least, it appeared to him to be. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Right. We&rsquo;ll head over.&rdquo;</span></p></body></html>
