</head><body class="c6 doc-content"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">T</span><span class="c3">hat girl, she was an oddity, though I&rsquo;d be the fool to suggest she was in any way ill. Her hair was in wires, and her face was much too pallid for her features. Her nose was bulbous and red, her cheeks roseate, her shoulders awfully bruised. Surrounding her eyes were dark, dark circles. A deep colour, they were as though one saw a dark winter night below her eyes&mdash; for white those eyes were, they appeared like a moon suspended above. Her eyelashes were ginger and so was her hair. She carried herself in such a manner that she begged pity, her legs so tightly wound in shyness that it were surprising she did not simply fall over at some slight wind or sound. Her arms were far too thin and abnormally hairy, for a girl&mdash; though for their reddish tint, they seemed to be much less noticeable were she brunette. They (who they were, I did not know. Though </span><span class="c3 c5">they</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;bothered me greatly) had her dressed in clothes fit for a grown woman. A beautifully ornate dress, too intricate for my taste. She appeared to me as some noblewoman&rsquo;s cake. A plaything. She herself seemed quite astounded to see me, not for my appearance but simply to see me. I had initially gotten the impression that she had just woken up. With that hair and all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, I had the impression that she at the very least did not want to be here. She had her lips peculiarly pursed, and her eyebrows quite narrowly furrowed. Given my own height, she really may have been no more than 1.27 meters. And more awfully, she was horridly quiet. She let not a single murmur slip from her lips. With such silence, one could feel to hear the rush of their blood along their ears and behind their eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not that I was annoyed with the girl&mdash; for in fact, I&rsquo;d much like her display a delicate melting smile. It was neither that I felt intimidated by her queerness. Rather, what appeared to grow inside me, or pick at my heart as though it were a thorn, was perhaps the conditions through which she had arrived at me. I left her there, for just a moment, as I sat down, reclining in my own large chair, feeling for papers placed beneath it. The papers contained little, if any, information about her. Parents of unknown origin, which I paid little mind to. Her age was not marked at a&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your age?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She only shook her head. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was an awful person to speak to. At least, in such state as we were in. There was little I could do. I could not roll in my head a single thought or scheme to arrive at her heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had leaned in closer, breaking the garish air of tension between her and I. &ldquo;Amelia,&rdquo; I spoke up. I said her name with a certain delicate nature, as one would silently call out to a loved one when you knew they could not hear you. &ldquo;What is your age?&rdquo; Asking the same question, it seemed to me, would not result in any success, but it was significantly better than letting this virgin sense of confidence I had sensed in her vanish. She did not make much of a movement. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eight,&rdquo; she said. Though, it was much more of a quiet rustle of her tongue. One might confuse her silent tone for the sound of the wind or leaves falling. But I had seen her lips move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eight, you say?&rdquo; I had begun to write into the notebook which I had with me, though it may have been too intimidating to have an adult write everything you said into a small sterile journal. I stopped. I saw her through the very edge of my glasses, where I had just hardly caught the light of her visage peering above its silver rim. She nodded. Eight, she said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eight.&rdquo; I looked at her. She made no attempt at finding a seat. I had not offered either. &ldquo;Give me a moment, please. Stay here.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I took off then, pulling the curtain to the room, before watching her as I left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Take a seat, please.&rdquo; She did. I left thereafter. The rest of the train, where we were situated, was quite clean and well put together. The furniture and atmosphere was quite antiquated for the time, resembling something more of the late French 18th century. I closed the curtain, leaving the girl, Amelia, alone. I was rather thirsty, so I had gone out. A few cars away I was aware of a small bar. As I walked past I saw several families in the seats. They appeared to be enjoying themselves greatly. Though it was late, and I&rsquo;d expect them all to retreat into the car with dormitories soon. My room was only so situated&mdash; near the main cars and bar&mdash; because it was a traveling Doctor&rsquo;s office. My office. Walking past I noticed the pompous figures, in great puffed out dresses. The men more modestly dressed, if one took the mere value of manufacturing. They had no less vulgar pride. Their children ran around her and there, scurrying behind and beneath seats like mice. Ignoring them, I moved along, only catching small glimpses here and there of quite extravagant looking women, in the ridiculous trends of the day.</body></html>
