</head><body class="c6 doc-content"><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He hopped out from the small hole. He prowled quietly along, quite close to the ground, his nose digging into dirt, his eyes set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hello, fox.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fox turned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where are you off to?&rdquo; It was a ridiculous looking owl, perched on a wretched, old&mdash; and mouldy&mdash; branch. It was astounding, felt the fox, that it supported such a weighty bird. His wings seemed too small, and his head was rather awkwardly sat upon his neck&mdash; or, it seemed to the fox, he had no neck at all. Just some large mass, quite unnerving; he decided to remain unmoved, ignoring the owl, and crawling further.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You! Fox, where do you go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fox stared deeply at the owl. The fox&rsquo;s eyes were dark stones, on whose glint the owl could faintly make out himself and, he noticed, how he shone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Have you no tongue?&rdquo; continued the owl. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Only the wind was heard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fox did not reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You damned Fox!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fox continued. As he did so, the owl continued to call out, annoyingly, some nonsense which was largely unintelligible. To the fox, the night was close and of great warmth to his frigid, delicate soul. What, thought the owl, must the fox do out so late?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rodents were heard, their wispy fur poking through the scant grounds. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said a mouse. His fur was brown, polished, and shining on their ends. His little tail swung side to side, brushing the short grass beneath him. He directed himself toward the fox. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Still, the fox paid no attention. The mouse trudged along with the fox. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, fox! Winter had come quick, and spring quicker. Have you no mind for the spring!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the distance, the horizon was adorned with small, miniature wooden homes, surely only housing no more than one, and the snow-gabled roofs cast a lovely silhouette, and they glowed beneath the virgin moon&rsquo;s dusty shafts of white light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fox, I must say, I have no further food, no further to feed myself for the coming weeks. I just beg Spring come quicker!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The mouse began to depart, scuttling in a sideward motion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The world is far too large for me, Fox.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bowing forward, his nose touched the ground; the mouse was gone. He caught the scent of cedar. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His paws sank further as he trode beside a large lake, whose own waters glistened.</span></p></body></html>
