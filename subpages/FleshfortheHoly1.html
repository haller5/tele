On such a morning as this, this particular morning, the skies were a pale blue tone, dressed in the light, dissolving veil of darkening skies. The man in robes&mdash; black cassock-styled robes which dragged along the ground as they reached his feet&mdash; trekked with great care along the dry-grass hills, which loomed in haunting images around him. The robes were secured tightly with a black belt along his waist, adorned with a bright white-silver buckle. Over his shoulders he was dressed with an elbow-length cape, which was buttoned vertically along his breast, with a collar over neck; the buttons were a glaring bronze. On this particular day he was collecting water from a well not far off the centre of the town; he was collecting it in large wooden jugs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; called a fair woman, running across the dry grass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She was surrounded with large, nude trees which offered little in shade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Arthur, concentrated on the well, made no notice of the sound. He heard only quiet distant bells which resounded with great strength across the open skies. It was early morning. The air was of tepid taste on his skin. Beneath the gaudy Sun, he showed his age, a wizened face, wrinkled at the outer edges of his eyes. Soon, he thought, the air&rsquo;d be dry. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; she called as she approached.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The jugs full, he let the water run, creating a dampened spot of dirt beneath at his feet, and a small subsequent puddle. A faint rainbow formed at his knees. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t seen a rainbow in many decades,&rdquo; he said to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She stood beside him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You normally fill the jugs facing the east,&rdquo; she replied. The rainbow was rather small and quaintly fit onto the length of the puddle. &ldquo;Rainbows only appear when you face away from the sun.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He faced away from the Sun to see the rainbow each morning.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Late autumn fell onto the village as lightly as early coats of winter snow, giving the atmosphere a cool scent, and the winds a foggy breath. Trapped in his small wooden church, with winds begging to enter, the man in robes was well-lit beside a chimney fire, where he sat on the floor and prayed. His book bore a tawny glow. He slept that night. When he awoke, he found his book in flames. He frantically got up, picking up the book in his hands, which were too quickly engulfed, as he searched around in despair for some water. He ran to the well and ran the book under the water stream. He suffered great burns on his palms and fingers, some of which he lost use from in the coming weeks. The book was left damp in the puddle beneath the well&rsquo;s faucet. He put on black gloves the next day to hide his hands, which he always wore</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">.He had no means to retrieve the contents of the Holy Book. He cried then that early, frigid morning. He kept a journal from then. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Caring for the sheep, he kept them moving along the early winter hills, as snow was a constant threat. He held a long wooden stick which he used to hit the animals, and to scare away any beasts while out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; called one of the townsfolk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He turned, facing the direction of the call. He saw nothing across the pale, rotting hills. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Herding the sheep, he saw red spread across the white mass. It seemed to him as though it were the spread of red paint over the woolly white canvas of the sheep-herd. He ran over to the centre, finding that their wool was wet with blood, which dripped unto the floor; it had a viscous texture, and stuck terribly at the ends of the wool, weighing down on the sides of the sheep. Grabbing at the wool, he noted no wounds of any sort. Down upon his own hands, he saw they wept with blood, which began seeping into the black gloves, leaving behind dark, scarlet stains on its leather surface. He moved with quickness, whisked about one way then the other by what appeared to be ghostly winds, the air was misty and foggy that morning, he found himself in utter dismay as the sheep scattered about, as he tripped on his robe, falling flat onto the hard, dry-soil ground. His hands shook before him, he daredn&rsquo;t even let them move. Keeping his hands apart, close to his chest, trembling, he sat up on his knees. His long, wiry, grey hair was swept back behind his ears. He hadn&rsquo;t shaved in weeks, and his face was buried beneath his gaunt appearance, where only his eyes shone, adorned with wrinkles on either side. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He murmured to himself. Pulling the gloves at the tip of the forefinger, he revealed to himself the slits on his palms, and the open flesh along its edges. They bled fervently. </span></p></body></html>
