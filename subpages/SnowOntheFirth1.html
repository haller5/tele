</head><body class="c6 doc-content"><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The campaign had crawled endlessly into a large, horrid, pallid expanse of dead grass and deader cadavers. Caught in the burly winds of winter, snowflakes gathered at their feet and struck their lips, which were a faint but loving pink. Their cheeks a flushed red, irregularly scattered, and their coats mottled with the nauseating scarlet of blood. As they trekked toward what appeared to them as only fog, their breath billowed before them into small, opaque mists, with specks of nearly melt snow. Though it were near impossible to discern, given the terrible conditions, it was largely clear that they stood on some wretched meadow, ugly-as-sin, on some northern European firth. Their boots crushed dry leaves, which was the only sound, save the near-constant soughing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Leaving no trail, they stopped at some clearing where trees grew dense around them. The bark was encrusted with ice, wearing it as one would glinting jewels. The men&rsquo;s eyelashes rimed with frost, they took off their helmets, shaking their hair and faces to throw off any clinging snow. Their boots were heavy, a dark grey. The sides were wet. They sat down, and dug out some dirt from the ground in order to set up some small fire. As they did so, one of them gazed intently. The flame reflected on their eyes, they brought their crucifix&mdash; which hung awkwardly around their neck, for it hung on by a quaint old string&mdash; to their lips. The fire burned brightly, illuminating their faces. Their foreheads shined with a warm, tawny glow, and seemed to melt, as if they were wax figures. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Lord, bathe us in your flames of strength and mercy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said the others, though their voices were rather low. The bitter cold made it undesirable to speak, for their mouths were nearly frozen shut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of them swung his satchel over his chest, reaching and pulling out a cigarette. Bringing it up to his own lips, the small flame from the lighter he brought to the head of the cigarette limned his solemn visage. His hair was haphazard and messy, with wisps all over, veiling his forehead. It was a light brown, but was really quite dull and thin. Thick eyebrows and very terrible and unkempt facial hair. Their coats were a light brown, like that of spring soil, and their trousers were a similar shade, only darker. Their helmets bore the insignia, a skull and two miniature crosses on either side. Bullet holes ran along its matte surface. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Franz, how is your family?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Terrible. Dead, maybe. Dead or not, it don&rsquo;t matter. I may as well be a spectre.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He stared down at the snow, holding a stick. He dragged it along, carving an S.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; He nodded to the other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He stuck his cigarette into the snow&mdash; extinguishing immediately. He dropped his head, letting out smoke toward his trousers. He sat with his knees up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Got no family.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They sat in silence. The branches swayed back and forth. It was not night, but it sure seemed like it. Was only the early nightfall. Yet hundreds of lights shimmered already in the violet sky. The winds were strong, borne by the neighbouring sea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were tired. Their heads felt heavy, and their blinking more frequent. The somnolent wintry night suffused the surrounding winds, and their heads soon fell into a deep dreary spell. Only the wilting flame could be heard, crackling deep into the mid-night. The world had gone to sleep. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">By next morning, the winds were only more bitter. The sun cast a glaring glow, and the garish snow was glinting. Gathering themselves, they picked up their winter caps, which had two large holes where the hair stuck out on top. It went around and below their chin, covering their ears; their ears were very cold. They each pulled out glacier goggles from their satchels. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your eye?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; He tugged at the bandage which wrapped his head, over his forehead and right eye, with his thumb. Pulling, he revealed a swollen area around the eye. The eye itself had decayed in colour, and was now a queer grey. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other man picked up a metal tag he had dropped, which itself bore the letters &ldquo;S.N.&rdquo; He shook off any snow. Along the distant horizon there was nothing but fog. Silhouettes of debris and homes lay still, almost jittering in place. Despite the dead appearance, shimmering lights flickered and danced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you suppose?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; He turned around, staring at the distant lights. &ldquo;Nothing. Just electric lamps.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Should we go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As they went across their steps crunched. Their coats capped in snow and frost, liquid water ran in rivulets across the leathery water-proof surface on their backs. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was nothing there. Nothing anywhere but nothing itself. Not that he knew. But as their campfire became obscured by the thick fog, consuming itself, blazing, he felt there was nothing. He reached into his pocket, pulling out a small platinum pocket watch. It no longer worked. The minute hand flickered in place, the roman numerals worn down and scratched. He let out a muggy breath as he held the watch close to his face. He wiped it clean, placing it back in his pocket. The place rot with sin, the electric lamps blazed, the wooden homes wicked with insects. Blood boiled, sputtering. In heaven and on earth, the rivers of blood cleansed sin. To his left he saw, through bleary eyes, a woman lying peculiarly, stretched outward, her face indiscernible, having been blown off. The wooden canvas behind bespattered in scarlet. Any red flesh remaining around her cheeks writhed like the flames on a candle. Her face melted. He reached deeply into the collar of his shirt, dragging out the crucifix. He laid it on his lips. He let his misty breath envelop the pleasant, wan figure of the Lord. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The soil was awfully cold. Small stones of ice were scattered and dug into. He was further inland; the wind blew with less strength, and the trees were much more densely grouped. Their leaves were of many colours. Though they all were neatly adorned with explosions of red which suffused the decaying bark. Franz moved through and between the trees until reaching the edge of the woods. There was a small settlement, composed of mostly wood, presumably from the forest, and was soaked from recent rain and snow, though it hadn&rsquo;t snowed for days now. Nearing a small cabin home full of antiques on outside shelves, he saw, through broken windows, that the place was dreadfully empty. On a small arch above the door, past the staircase, swung an old lantern. It was kept lit with kerosene, producing an unpleasant smell. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Franz went up the stairs, faltering as he went, holding himself up with the bolt-action rifle he carried. It was made of mostly a reddish, polished wood, with many stripes. It had also a very thin strap, grey with dust. His lips felt very dry. Peering through the various small rooms, he noticed himself in the mirror. He bore a much gaunter appearance than he had last seen. His clothing was pitiful and torn, though his coat maintained its thick vividness. He placed his palm over his covered eye. The other eye glinted with a quiet verdant sheen. The bandages were stretched and tearing at the edges. His hair poked through gaps on the sides in thinning wisps. His hair was long, nearly completely obscuring his eyebrow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Stepping outside, he felt a small chill. It was still early morning, though the sun was long past the horizon. The sky had a clear look, though the clouds were full, gathered in large heaps. The sky was vibrant. Through it he saw the sparkling ocean bay&mdash; however he hadn&rsquo;t seen it in many years now. His heavy boots crunched over melted snow and twigs. Reaching the largest building, he sat down on the steps. His rifle dropped to the snow. From his satchel he pulled out an old leather journal along with a metal pen. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Amalia. I wish I had learned to love you, as you did I. Amalia. Amalia. Amalia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The name seemed strange written many times. He wrote the date. He saw the last entry was five months before. He put the journal away. As he lowered his gaze into his satchel, a cat walked up to him, curling around his leg on the stair. It was a black cat with green eyes. Its whiskers were rather long. It seemed young. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He bent forward to feel its fur. He wore large, brumal gloves. He felt along the kitten&rsquo;s sleek pelt. The kitten moved around his leg. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know, cat.&rdquo; He suspired. &ldquo;All season I manage. But certain mornings I just think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He looked up. The clouds had moved. He picked up the cat and laid him onto his lap. The cat felt snug and closed its eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thinking is rare. And so is love.&rdquo; His voice was shy. &ldquo;She told me I&#39;m terrible at both.&rdquo; He smiled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He pulled off the glove from his right hand. He felt the fur with his cold fingers. The cat&rsquo;s skin was warm beneath it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been far too long.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Everything was distant. I wonder if she&rsquo;d care for me. Were she only still alive, I suppose. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The cat vanished. And everything did. He felt only numbness. Slowly feeling returned, and his eye regained vision, though very blurry vision. He saw someone before him, standing. He saw the cat run. He felt only the faint, tepid stream of blood along his cheeks. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The man before him was equipped with a bayonet fixed onto a wooden carbine. The bayonet was plunged into Franz&rsquo;s open eye. He saw through only small, bleary vision, a bleak setting. The trees which wrapped along the settlement&rsquo;s border felt far. He sat on those steps. Blood trickled in streams from his eye socket. Wind blew through it. He felt the blood soak his dry lips. And the man; the man pulled the trigger, blowing a bullet through the socket, which coursed through. It smashed through glass windows behind Franz. He then retracted slowly, leaving Franz. He walked backward in slow step, before running, disappearing amidst the misty trees. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Franz lay dejectedly. The cat pranced around behind the large cabin, following a squirrel. Its fur was stained with lustrous blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. Put it on, it&rsquo;ll rain harder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From his bag, slung around his shoulder, he pulled out a rain cape, of a thin, water-proof material, it was a beige colour of some kind. He pulled it over his head and tugged at the corners. He threw on the hood. Everyone was wearing their cape now. The rain was much stronger and was very loud. The cement beneath their feet was glistening with small, growing pools of rainwater. It gathered at curbs and ran down&mdash; however slowly&mdash; the sloped roads. The sounds were sweet and pleasant, though thundering. The clouds above were thick and dark and they moved with swiftness along the darkening skies, where nightfall began to settle in on the very horizon, where the veil of indigo was pulled through, the sun leaving only its small grainy glow, reminiscent of a faint fire at a distance. Nearby, the others began to gather at the marble steps, huddling beneath the overhang of the large monumental building. Large pillars were worn on either side, and were beginning to fall to green, as moss and growth crept their sides. They circled around, sitting on the dry ground and, pulling off their hoods, warmed at the small fire they had set up. The fire cast a delicate, suffusing splinter of light onto their pleasant visages. They wore a waxy texture, as their wet faces appeared as though they were melting amidst the warmth. From where he stood, the light flickered, and shined through the gaps in between the men, dimming&mdash;glowing&mdash; then dimming and glowing again. Small sparks of flame thrust upward, extinguished, followed by another. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sit.&rdquo; One looked at him, gesturing forward. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay standing. I&rsquo;m not tired.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Not about tiredness. Come talk.&rdquo; He smiled. He was missing a tooth on the left. His beard was unkempt and looked dry, with thick, grey hairs poking in arbitrary direction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He ignored him and walked around the group of men, and past them. The marble floors dissolved into mosaics at the entrance. Large, tall doors were in front of him. They were carved with beautiful designs. The doorknob was golden, dullened by wear. His own outfit was in contrast. His gaunt, soaking rain cape. Beneath, a torn coat, which ran scarlet with blood on the sleeved ends, his trousers were decorated with dust and dirt, his boots adorned with mud and gravel, losing their polished, brown colour and their masculine vigour.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The rain was muffled where he stood. He pulled off the cape, wrapping it around his waist. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;They are in there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; He jumped, turning to see Nikolaus. &ldquo;They are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The others are resting,&rdquo; said Nikolaus, as he pushed open the door. The door slid with great difficulty, dragging on the wooden flooring. Inside the palace was an elegant display. The floor appeared to be recently polished, the carpet extended horizontally from one wall to the other, with illustriously sewn patterns of bears and lions, all along. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you carry?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Only this shotgun.&rdquo; He felt at his coat, where beneath it he concealed a short-barrel shotgun in holster. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Take this.&rdquo; He handed him a carbine rifle. Nikolaus swung his own rifle from his back. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Before the both of them there was a large set of stairs which tapered at the top, revealing the second floor, where it split into indoor balconies on either side, leading to their hallways. The wall was adorned with large oil-painted portraits. The railings were a soft gold. Figures stood, small sculptures in the corners. There were many plants and flowers, large towering stems with their deep, green leaves dropped, bending&mdash; drooping&mdash; far past the pots they resided in, which themselves were beautiful pots of indiscernible splendour. They were mythical, with their many little designs of small men dressed in mediaeval garments.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terribly cold!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Her voice was warm through the snowy wind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes! Look at my nose!&rdquo; Her nose was a faint, deep shade of red, and her cheeks were blemished in roseate hue. Her face was pale and there was seen the subtle blood mottled beneath, in small ink-blots. She wore a large overcoat, which made her thin figure look awkwardly wide. Her boots were large and her loose trousers were dirtied in mud at the knees. She wore a beautiful brown headscarf, covering halfway up her head, revealing only her somnolent face and the wisps of hair poking from the front of the veil. Her lips were strangely untinted save for a pale pink tone. Her hair was a very light brown. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He smiled. Crunching the snow beneath, he walked over, in large strides, to the nearest tree. Its bark was reddish-brown, and was tall and scarred. Its dead leaves fluttered about, clinging to a small radius, dancing in circles. He bent over, where a small hill of snow had gathered at the base of the trunk. Moulding a small snowball, albeit with some soil and small, torn scraps of bark, he turned and tossed it at her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, stop it!&rdquo; She was caught off guard. The snowball shattered into flakes at her shoulder. She had small flakes of the powdery snow on her eyelashes and her eyebrows. She bent, gathering her own, and tossed a snowball rather hard. This time, the snowball had smashed onto his ear which was left exposed. His own hair was covered in powder. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Back and forth they had thrown snowballs, as the bright blue sky began to descend, and clouds gathered in voluminous clumps. There was no strategy, as it was just play. They threw one past the other over again, gathered, threw, and laughed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sat at a tree, where shade covered, they breathed heavily, their breath was mystical and opaque. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The first snowball hurt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She held his earlobe, inspecting it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s red,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very cold, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you bring some cover?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I forgot. I just came here to see you, and realised too late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What rotten reason.&rdquo; She brushed her hair back into the headscarf, behind her ear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was very quiet. There was the occasional sound of a rabbit which moved quickly through shrubs and the small growth around them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Have you seen the capital?&rdquo; She drew in the snow as she spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The capital?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well I have. I went with my father long ago. When I was around five years old.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Long time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, clearly. I saw the gorgeous steps. It&rsquo;s rather large, too, I say. Looks larger than the pictures. Doesn&rsquo;t do it justice, I think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Looks large in the pictures.&rdquo; He turned to look at her. She had drawn the silhouette of a rabbit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was a careful static in the cold, wintry air. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Would you take me?&rdquo; She looked up at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So it would be a great opportunity. You and I go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The atmosphere was awfully still. Surely they were lost, he thought. Though she knew this place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, maybe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to go.&rdquo; She looked down, wiping away the snow sketch with her large gloves, before returning her gaze. &ldquo;With you, I suppose.&rdquo; Blinking, small snowflakes fell from her eyelashes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He returned the smile. Though he felt his was insincere, as though he had some dreary, woeful look. He felt miserable. Or perhaps he was simply tired. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Crossing the lurid chamber was difficult. And it was exhausting. The palace was bright and verdant. It was furthermore nauseating. Their scuttling, the mud dragging on the carpet, moving with great caution, seemed&mdash; from above the glass, opalescent chandeliers&mdash; to be some slow waltz. The chandeliers swung, flames flickered amidst the blazing lights. Long shadows moved with them, swinging from one end to another, stretching over the staircase, and farther. Their heavy clothing sagged, and the sound of their guns clanging resounded, wood on wood, in a hollow echo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Before the stairs they took a sharp left. There was a large kitchen. So grand, the countertops stretched all along the walls, many sinks of glistening metal, water dripping from their ends; it almost seemed that one were not in a state of complete despair. Nikolaus felt close along the countertops of delicate marble. His gloved hands brushed along as he walked, leaving traces of dust and soil. The fireplace was magnificent; it was a large thing, very large. The fire inside was ablaze and ashes spattered one way and another, falling upon the wooden floors. Nikolaus kneeled at the fire. He walked over to meet him. His eyes were dark, though tiny flames reflected in his irises. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He nodded. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Nikolaus covered his face with his hands, running them up through his hair, where thin wisps poked through the in-betweens of his fingers. His face was harshly set; he had rough skin, and it was porous. Small groupings of freckles went along the bridge of his nose and beneath his eyes. He had only a large, thick, dark moustache through which hardly any of his upper lip was seen. Coming up, he looked around. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Find the basement.&rdquo; He spoke quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The basement?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, the basement. Someone is here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who would that be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Find the basement.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said. He left Nikolaus at the brick fireplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The rest of the hallway felt long and appeared to drag into itself, some whirling maze. Each chamber was large, the effulgent chandeliers and ceilings, with their adornments, were much like the skies outside&mdash; but warmer. As if to mimic the scene, his own head felt as though it whirled into itself. The palace was revolting and his eyes stung, growing bleary. He could feel his own forehead become increasingly warm. Feeling along the walls, where the wallpaper, brown wallpaper with thin golden lines&mdash; the room was incredibly awful&mdash; felt cold on his fingertips, he came across the primary living quarters. A large table, with furniture all about, couches and large comfortable chairs. He held his rifle steady. There was a large steel door along the back, obscured by large ferns and other tall plants. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treading lightly upon the wooden floors, he swung the door open. Heavy, it dragged on the flooring, scraping. He walked down the stairs, heading into what appeared to him as the basement. Below, though largely dark, he could make out steel beams and walls, all around him, and wooden doors, quaint wooden doors&mdash; scraped and splintered and mouldy wooden doors. Opening one of them, he was met with what seemed like some messy labyrinth of steel and wood. His own steps resounded, echoing distantly at some muffled tone. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Look at this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Over here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He turned over from where he was splitting the firewood. She pointed at a yellow flower poking from the thick snow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The flower. Look at it. Isn&rsquo;t that strange?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes it is. Must be nearing the end of winter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought. Have you any idea the date?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I forgot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Spring must be near, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sure. Though we still need fire. The snow is quite thick.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He turned back. She knelt down, her nose angled downward toward the flower. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I would pluck it. But it looks so strange there, it&rsquo;s beautiful. Golden in the midst of winter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He went through various doors. Until he stumbled across a room, with its decaying walls, where the family was huddled tightly. The parents had this awful look, completely afraid, their eyes wide open as they kept their gaze on him and his rifle. The father had a nice suit, however worn, buttoned-up. The mother wore a large, brumal, elegant dress. The young girl, in her early adolescence, wore a thin dress which hung gauntly on her timid body. She was thin herself. There was also a small, young boy, no older than eight, with a ghastly appearance; his cheeks utterly hollow. Sitting in the awkward position in which he was, he clung tightly to a dreadful sewn stuffed animal representing a rabbit. The large ears were ripping at the seams, the legs had lost the puff one would assume it once had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He kept his gaze on the boy, whose shirt was too short. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He held up his rifle, preparing his finger. The strap dangled, attracting the family&rsquo;s glare. It swung along, from one side to the other. The delicate leather material was hypnotising, scintillating as it swung beneath the overhead hanging lamp, whose blazing electric base was held on by strung, dangerous wiring which broke through the cement ceiling. The boy&rsquo;s face was spotted and dark with soot. Though his eyes radiated. His irises seem to jitter in place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They made no sound. The decorate-striped walls behind them were washed in red, and holes ran through its surface. The wood seen inside was rotten. It ran in glowing rivulets at slow pace. He kept his gaze directly in front of him, though they were no longer there. Scanning upwards, he saw the viscous, dappled blood beside the hanging lamp. He stood there. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From behind came Nikolaus. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Winter is nearly over, in a few days.&rdquo; He stood quietly. &ldquo;I found food.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He turned to face Nikolaus. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then tell the others. I&rsquo;ve no need to know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Nikolaus saw the boy. He turned and walked away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is no honourable way to sentence death,&rdquo; he said as he retreated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He stood, with his gaze on the boy. Nikolaus had vanished up the stairs. &ldquo;There is no honourable death,&rdquo; he whispered. He knelt beside the boy and, carefully reaching out his hand, keeping his distance, kept one finger straightened and hooked it around the rabbit&rsquo;s arm, dragging it toward himself. He held it in his palm, before too retreating and vanishing with the rabbit up the stairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The palace was no longer as bright, but had begun to dim as the sun had completely dipped below the earth. The violet skies showered through the large, open, uncurtained windows. He went along, reaching the palace doors which were open. The many men all were coming inside, their eyes shining with unsullied awe. They ignored his own tepid gaze. He brushed along through all of them, out into the open cold. Outside his forehead felt no longer hot and he felt the clear breeze. A refreshing breeze. His own eyes began to water as the cold winds went against his face. He turned left, disappearing into the misty air, where the rain fell hard outside the palace&rsquo;s large overhang. Streams of water cascaded along the edges, seeping into the soil at the front garden. Through the green thicket, whose colour was vibrant even deep into late winter, he arrived on the left wing. He leaned against the large walls, dragging into the soft soil, until he sat with his legs slightly tucked. He held the rabbit in both hands, his thumbs over the wizened nose. He tucked his knees closely, pulling the rabbit toward his chest. He ducked his head. The rain clattered on the roof above him. He wept. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His tears were warm and streaked along his rough face. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He does not know how long he was outside. But after some while, he heard muffled steps approach him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kraus.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He turned to face the voice. One of the men was saddled over a large brown horse. Its fur was matted and wet. It made low noises, though the rain made it hard to hear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kraus,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we found horses in the stables.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He began to stand up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t be here long then, I suppose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No I suppose not, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He rode off toward the empty roads with the horse, turning right toward the palace doors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Kraus was left alone. As he walked through the marshy ground, his boots sinking deeply into the flooded soil, he saw small flakes of snow descend with grace unto his nose, where the sky was open above him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They began to descend quickly, and in only moments, some light snow was beginning to make itself evident in the dark sky. Winter was near past, though it appeared the snowy weather would persist into spring. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had not noticed he left the rabbit to sink into the waterlogged garden grounds. In days, only some faint mark of its silhouette was visible in the effulgent spring snow.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Caught on the coldest and most nude of early nights, the skies were overcast, where the moon&rsquo;s shine penetrated the thick, foggy air and lit the scarcely snowy soil with a sweet, white glow. A thin layer of soft metallic sheen had fallen over the sleepy forest. It had snowed. However, to the animals, it were almost as if it had not just snowed. The snow was well into melting, and the frost was well into thawing, and the soil was left with a damp, miserable look. In fact, in no more than a few hours, rain began to fall, first in drizzle, then in cascades, onto the foggy, drowsy landscape. But, this too the fox did not hear. He had slept well through it all. His nose wrinkled, that is all. When the moon had reached its highest point, the fox yawned, opening its mouth widely, before digging its paws into the soft ground. His den was small and humble, with some twigs of decoration poking out this side, then the other, and some leaves for a carpet&mdash; or some bed. Shaking off dirt, he then poked through the hole in the top; he was near a large redwood tree. It matched his sleek pelt nicely, whose reddish-brown hue was equally strange and warm. Breathing through his nostrils, he blew leaves from right before him. The winds were harsh and cold. Colder than the snow, it seemed to the fox. His eyes were quickly teary. </span></p></body></html>
