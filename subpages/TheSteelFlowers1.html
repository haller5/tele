</head><body class="c7 doc-content"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Professor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Professor Calince stood near the deck which overlooked the outside. The large stained window, darkly to a great degree, made only visible the slight whispers of light which twinkled against an otherwise abyssal sky&mdash; or floor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Professor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Professor Calince could not hear. Rather, he turned his attention toward a small nut which fastened the window unto a raised, fastened flange of sheet metal. Closely, too closely, his eyeglasses nearly touched against the glass&mdash; his appearance was rather peculiar, when one saw it in such a movement. He was leaned in incredibly closely, his legs unnaturally straightened in position as his bent torso lowered his gaze toward the feature of the glass. His tie hung down, swinging lightly, and his striped dress shirt was carelessly loosened from his trousers. His brown boots remained firmly planted. Most peculiar of all, though not uncommon for many men at his advanced age&mdash; fourty-five, were his pair of eyeglasses. Mimicking a 20th century austere thin frame of steel, the square lenses had mounted upon the left eye three layers of lenses which got thicker as they numbered further, held up by some seemingly arm-like chassis which held them up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">He flicked about on the arm with his thumb, switching up the thicker, outer lens&mdash; in place, out, in, out, changing the magnification of his view. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Err&hellip; Professor,&rdquo; he continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Professor Calince flinched at the words. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Ahh, dear Dreasnen,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Professor, I was sent to inform you that we have begun to dock along a larger station. The Supreme Baron Leasneare shall see to it that you meet with him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Supreme Baron?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the title.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What an antiquated title? Is he from a family of aristocrats?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;It appears that&rsquo;s the case. But, in any event, you may browse our documents to learn more about him in the Enkyklios.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I shall see to it, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Is there anything more, sir?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Professor Calince had, during the duration of the short exchange, not taken his eye off the nut. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Why, yes. Now that it occurs to me. This Supreme Baron Leasneare may contact me soon enough, then; whereupon I will send a message out to you. Be on the watch, as I wish for you to attend the meeting with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Alright, sir. And anything more?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;And may I ask, why invite me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;As for that; wherefore I cannot say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dreasnen walked down the long hall which extended out from the glass window, leaving the Professor in quiet meditation. He thought an awful lot about the Professor. In no time, he descended down a flight of stairs into a bright, gaudy lobby brimming with bleary, pallid orange lights which hung from the high ceiling. Whereupon where he went, it can not be said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The Professor flicked the varying degrees of magnification. When he bored himself of the motion, he vanished down a large steel door to the right of the window, whence there was to be found a large lounge, in a peculiar and bureaucratic post-modern style, littered with an odour of reports and papers. He lay on one of the large circular couches, which were subtly uncomfortable. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The next morning was light in air, the atmosphere was rather cool, and the furniture had gathered dust overnight. Dreasnen had slept in the collective dormitories. His alarm had woken him at a precise hour. The hour, however, was not known. Only the relative passing of hours was recorded. Night and day were recorded however, in some sense. Though the recording was kept in the lower chambers in the data storages. The time was recorded in accordance with the time on Earth. To the officials, it did not matter. They fell upon the instincts of flesh to decide when to sleep and when to rise. Dreasnen, to follow a strict scheduled routine, set a timer for nine hours from when he slipped into bed. To accomodate for the varying sleeping schedules of the bureaucratic officials, the dormitories were kept in complete darkness always. The room really only contained the beds. Metal frames with great soft mattresses, each identical to the other. Their belongings were kept collectively in another branch of the station where each official had a small chamber dedicated to their own needs. There was a bathroom, a storage unit, and a desk. Dreasnen entered his.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The chamber was of a particularly interesting appeal. The entire sideward wall was a very thick bullet-proof glass. It was not tinted. Through it, the glare of the Sun cast a burning glow which suffused the room with a tawny lustre over the white steel walls and floorings. The desks and chairs were constructed from a thin, lightweight titanium. For Dreasnen, his desk was scattered with papers, though they were numbered and orderly&mdash; &lsquo;scattered&rsquo; may be too harsh of a word, as they were really quite neatly piled up, it seemed to him. Though to anyone looking in, a pile of papers seemed like any pile of papers. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The sun&rsquo;s glare was so immense, that all officers were required to keep with themselves darkening goggles&mdash; </span><span class="c4 c5">megala</span><span class="c4">, they were named. Dreasnen had with him his own pair, number B489-SCO. The </span><span class="c4 c5">megala </span><span class="c3">were a metallic silver. Visible upon its surface were the striations left after manufacturing. The megala&rsquo;s metal band, solid and measured to the precise cranial measurements provided by each officer, was connected, through welding, to the large lens holders. Large cylinders which protruded a great deal, perhaps two inches, from the base, where the thick dark glass lens was nestled into the respective slots. Given the solidified nature of the band, the megala were worn more like a crown, sitting tightly on the head&rsquo;s crown, with the lens&rsquo; cylindrical housing was attached underneath the band&mdash; in other words, the metallic band rested somewhere along the forehead, and from there the lens housing was attached on the bottom edge, falling upon the eyes. The lens could be flipped upward, as they were attached on a sort of hinge of sorts. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Dreasnen entered his own miniature chamber, he flipped the lenses onto his eyes. The entire room went dark. In fact, the particular reason for all the furniture and important features being constructed in a white steel was to allow the sun&rsquo;s glare to reflect more brightly and outline the furniture silhouettes in light even through the darkening megala. Were it not for the highly reflective material&mdash; were it something like wood&mdash; the furniture would be utterly lost in the darkened projection of the room seen through the megala.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dreasnen sat at his desk, opening all the drawers. The papers, too, were made of a reflective material&mdash; this limited the variety of instruments to a very peculiar pen with a highly matte ink. As he did so, opening and closing, he noted the phone on his desk in suddenness wake into a loud ringing. He picked up the phone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Dreasnen, are you occupied.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Err&hellip;&rdquo; he looked at the room around him. He clicked the phone apparatus to set it to a loud speaker. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m quite free at the moment, is there anything you need to say? Also, who is this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;The Boern; The Boern Federation, under S. Baron Leasneare.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Ermhm&hellip; I see,&rdquo; continued Dreasnen, falling to the floor, looking for a writing utensil. &ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;The Professor spoke with the Baron overnight and encouraged the Baron to allow him to bring you along. I call to confirm if you are willing and cooperative in this regard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;To meet the Baron? Sure, yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;And do please remember to check&mdash; we sent out a brochure of cultural etiquette&mdash; in your mail. It&rsquo;s important so as to make the best of an impression. And furthemore, as for clo&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Mail? Physical mai&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes, physical mail. We sent it out through a mail carrier, he is aboard the station you are currently residing in. He has your&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Does he have my chamber&rsquo;s number? That&rsquo;s where I receive papers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was going to say. Yes,&rdquo; replied the phone, uncharacteristically; it had lost a bit of its kind tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Dreasnen continued wrestling with the pile of mail on the ground, pushing aside to find a pen. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c5">When </span><span class="c3">was I supposed to see this mail?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Early in the morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Mhm&hellip;&rdquo; He paused for thought. He stood quickly, leaving aside what he was doing. &ldquo;Could you give me a moment?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied the phone, uncouthly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dreasnen opened the large steel cabinet doors, fidgeting with the knob contained on the inner wall sideward from his gaze. A small plastic knob. Spinning it, the clothing inside swiveled, as it was controlling a carousel of clothing. Stopping upon seeing the desired outfit, he changed quickly into what were hyper sleek and minimal large white trousers, dark brown side-zipped boots and a starkly flush-white regency-styled shirt tucked into the pants, with a quite ornate-buckled leather belt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Just a moment!&rdquo; He shouted quietly at the phone. He tossed his hands into some gloves and stepped outside, treading into the next chamber. He did not have the appropriate code&mdash; or, rather, he </span><span class="c4 c5">shouldn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;have had the code; though, he did&mdash; as he did, he dialed the numbers accordingly, taking great care not to touch anything of too great importance. He got a pen from the desk and went back out, the steel doors closing behind him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Alright, sorry for the wait.&rdquo; Dreasnen entered his own chamber, alarmed by the silence of the phone in response. He hesitated to say anything again. He looked at the ground; from where he stood, laying neatly between his feet, was the brochure. It had just been slipped beneath the door. Only moments before. He picked it up and sat back down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh, are you back?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here. Was there anything more?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Not in particular. So you will be able to attend, you had said?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Dreasnen, in a hyper-affirmative tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So do </span><span class="c4 c5">you</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;have any questions?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dreasnen paused. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;The Federation of what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Boern.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the genealogy of the Baron. It&rsquo;s an aristocratic title, quite antiquated. Is he at all actually related to any form of sub-nobility?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the brochure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;But I can respond to your questions,&rdquo; continued the phone. &ldquo;So far as I have the time,&rdquo; he appended. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Alright, perfect!&rdquo; retorted Dreasnen to the enthusiastic phone. &ldquo;Starting with what I had just asked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The Baron&rsquo;s ancestry stretches to the particular Consortium Belanze, of primarily five families&mdash; there were six, but its relationship to the rest is admittedly complex, so I will omit it in favour of a primacy of </span><span class="c4 c5">penta-geneia</span><span class="c3">. In any case, there were the five families. They were already of some marginal wealth due to excelling in minor trades of paraphernalia, particularly in fabric. The city from which they hail was largely known for its expansive amount of merchants, so their involvement was of no initial particular outstanding significance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;To speed things up, we start with these five families. Following a major famine which beset the entire State and its subjects&mdash; the merchants&mdash; the family </span><span class="c4 c5">Gerlen</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;had struck what had appeared to be a large underground forest of trees. It was somewhat like a grotto, and it contained a great expanse of trees. The specific importance and takeaway is that the trees bore a fruit which served as a miracle food. The density of nutrients was unlike any other. It could be used as an entire meal. Three meals a day. The </span><span class="c4 c5">Gerlen</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;understood this and began to experiment with quickening the growth of the trees. They&rsquo;d start with initiating trade with the more highly innovatively technological merchant guilds East of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Trees of miracle fruit? What fruit was this?&rdquo; Dreasnen leaned in closely in his chair. &ldquo;Is that the food we eat? Though we have no such na&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c5">Dendron Hahayim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is the name of the fruit. This story is the tale of genesis of the fruit of life. It has since become quite commonplace aboard stations in order to maintain an efficiency of food dispensed for the quality of life of the staff. Though now the fruit is very different to that which was discovered by the </span><span class="c4 c5">Gerlen</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;family of ages ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Different how?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Well, fruits change over time, as they are modified and experimented with. The trees are bred with others to create stronger varieties, you see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Okay, then.&rdquo; He sat back down in a more relaxed manner. &ldquo;Sorry, continue.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Well, then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;In order to initiate trade with the guilds of the East </span><span class="c4 c5">Fiorianso</span><span class="c4">, the Gerlen family found it ideal to build up their own guild, of which they entrusted membership to families which worked in industry similar to them, and shared blood lineage through some inconsistent amount of mixing that had occurred between them, marriages and such. These were the </span><span class="c4 c5">Renecart</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c4 c5">Tlanck</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c4 c5">Pourenne</span><span class="c4">, and the </span><span class="c4 c5">Leasneare</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;families. The last of which, I&rsquo;m sure you recognise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This guild of families, known broadly as the </span><span class="c4 c5">pentageneia</span><span class="c4">, and more officially&mdash; formally&mdash; as </span><span class="c4 c5">Consortium Belanzium</span><span class="c4">&mdash; or </span><span class="c4 c5">Belanze</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in more modern transliterations of the language into the vernacular. Nonetheless, this guild&mdash; consortium&mdash; was able to amass enough wealth to make further trade with the East. This began with technological apparatuses which would facilitate the cultivation of a section of the forest. The rest of the forest would be dedicated to experiment. With the revenue pulled in from the first batch of fruits, they poured it all into innovative agricultural practices. The particular nature of these practices and techniques are known to only the family, and the original seed of </span><span class="c4 c5">Methuselah</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is kept secure, providing the original genetic blueprint for which all the others are measured against.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;How old is this tree?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Nine-hundred sixty eight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Nine-hundred sixty eight? And is that the end of the history?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;To some extent, yes. Of course, I did mention another family. I will give you the name&mdash; the </span><span class="c4 c5">Hendreach</span><span class="c4">. Their role was largely minimal in the development of the </span><span class="c4 c5">penta-geneia</span><span class="c4">&rsquo;s legacy. However, I will add to the history&mdash; after their initial wealth accrued which followed their success with the tree, they began to use the fruit directly to trade with the East, thus practically producing a direct monetary value for the fruit. The East guilds would upsell the fruit in their region, and was more than glad to receive it as payment over the pure money&rsquo;s value of the technology which they were trading. However, what they did not anticipate was that the </span><span class="c4 c5">penta-geneia</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;had effectively created an economic dependence on the fruit, which they could now infinitely &lsquo;print&rsquo; in some manner. Grow. They had created a fiscal hegemonic foundation from which they could dominate the trade structure of </span><span class="c4 c5">Florianso</span><span class="c4">. The East and West were united under the fruit&rsquo;s underlying scaffold of economic growth. It created an unprecedented dependence on the five families&mdash; </span><span class="c4 c5">consortium Belanzium</span><span class="c4">&mdash; which lent itself quite easily to a political outwardness of the family. By creating the economic substructure of the region, the superstructure grew out of the economic policies as social institutions, cultural institutions, and political life, all of which revolved around the maintenance of this substructure by the </span><span class="c4 c5">penta-geneia</span><span class="c4">. They had a </span><span class="c4 c5">hegemony over violence</span><span class="c4">. In simple political terms, they had created a State. A State which serves to maintain the economic subtrcuture through its promotion of cultural and political life that reflected and defended the substructure. The very nature of the fruit would make it easy to extend this outward to the outer worlds from </span><span class="c4 c5">Florianso</span><span class="c3">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;To keep things simple, from then, this initial expansion of growth happened within the first century after the discovery of the </span><span class="c4 c5">Methuselah</span><span class="c4">&mdash; the event is colloquially known as </span><span class="c4 c5">Eros-Sphota. </span><span class="c4">But I may refer to it as the </span><span class="c4 c5">erotas</span><span class="c4">. The erotas, about a century later, was when the order of aristocracy beset itself with the five jewels of the consortium&mdash; those names which I had mentioned; </span><span class="c4 c5">Gerlen</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c4 c5">Renecart</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c4 c5">Tlanck</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c4 c5">Pourenne</span><span class="c4">, and the </span><span class="c4 c5">Leasneare</span><span class="c4">. From then, the names of the families are now so strangely detached from their history, that their only semblance of self-importance come from their titles and their wealth. I find it hard to believe they are at all involved now in the </span><span class="c4 c5">Consortium Belanzium</span><span class="c3">, which has since grown larger and more abstracted from the original five families. Headed by holders of wealth, businessmen, it&rsquo;s driven more bureaucratically than the traditions of the old aristocratic order of the families. In this way, it&rsquo;s less of a familial order, and more of a corporate apparatus which continues the legacy of research. Though, a great deal of the wealth still makes its way to the families, as they are primary shareholders, but have no influence in the apparatus on the whole.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Truly, I wonder what happened. This is the bits of history that began to dissolve in time. It is so little known that, as I said, most do not even know of the original families. I tell you here now, lest you be one of those such people. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Though, let me say to you&hellip;&rdquo; he paused. The phone went into a static silence. For a moment he could hear some movement on the other end. &ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dreasnen waited. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I do not understand the nature of the families today. I am a faithful servant and part of the counsel of </span><span class="c4 c5">Leasneare</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c5">knights</span><span class="c3">. As you know, Baron does not seem a particularly high rank. In fact, it is as you suspect. Baron Leasneare&mdash; his full name is Markon P. Leasneare. He is beneath the ranks Viscount, Earl, Marquess, Duke, and of course the Lord and Majesty Supreme Leasneare of the highest rank. The head. Baron is the last of the ranks. Really, he is only marginally related to the pure lineage of blood of the family. The rest are moreso just noble commoners who reside in the regal interstellar stations of the respective families. Anyway&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Do the other families have similar structures?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Uhmm&hellip; Yes, I believe so. See, one thing you have to know about&hellip;&rdquo; The phone paused. &ldquo;Yes&hellip; as I was saying, the one thing you have to know, or take away from this is that the families are more relics of the past than anything actually powerful. Figureheads for themselves. They are an outdated piece of history which has somehow maintained isolation for the past near-millenia. Well, more about the last several centuries. The current heads of the family have been keeping&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;So, for the others, Baron is still keenly related to the primary lineage of the family, though? As in, the other members, less related, only inhabit lesser forms of nobility? How is they&rsquo;re way of living?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes, Baron is highly related, just among the lowest of those high blood-relations. The rest are the common nobility, who still lavish themselves in the wealth&mdash; it is more like an allowance they receive here and there. A hefty sum, I must say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;And what are you? A knight, you said? What is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;An ancient order which was part of the original </span><span class="c4 c5">Consortium Belanzium</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;paramilitary and secret police.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;And so you are a part of that succession?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s thus also a pseudo-familiar order. I say pseudo because it has been mixed incredibly with other orders from other powerful guilds. In that way we maintain contact with other guilds&rsquo; paramilitary organisations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Mhm&hellip; Alright, then. Anyway, about the current heads of the family?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes, of course. So&hellip; as I was saying&mdash; the current heads of the family have been keeping steady openness to the mainstream political and economic state of the interstellar Orders. They are willing to increase cooperation and participation and contributing to the current orders. This new openness has been signaled with increased diplomatic relationships by the Supreme Marquess and Supreme Lord. The Duke lives a rather secluded life. These two have made more public appearances than the orders have seen in the last several centuries. It is of course incredibly welcomed, due to their immense wealth. And, that more austere and aristocratic nature of things is slowly dissolving within the family, as they adopt the more loosened cultural etiquettes of the common orders in hopes of increasing relationship trust and building familiarity. Were they to maintain their strict and pallid traditions, they would be seen as awfully ancient and superstitious&mdash; in other words, rather untrustrworthy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;However, I must address the Baron&rsquo;s peculiarities here. I send the brochure&mdash; which you said you received, or did you not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Dreasnen reacted promptly and looked down at the brochure at his hands. &ldquo;I have it here with me.&rdquo; It was a neat brochure made with parchment paper and a leather binding. In fact, it looked more like a passport. The inside was handwritten in hardly legible writing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Alright. Well, I asked you to look at the brochure to ensure that you be aligned with the will of the Baron. He is incredibly particular aobut the cultural etiquette maintained along his station. The </span><span class="c4 c5">Glennar</span><span class="c4">, he called it. It used to have a different name, in accordance with that which the first Baron appointed had named it. He was the first, the current Baron, to change it. Well, as I mentioned the family is becoming more open to the current orders&mdash;&rdquo; He got quiet on the phone. &ldquo; &mdash; The Baron has </span><span class="c4 c5">not</span><span class="c4">. He has taken the opposite directive and is incredibly aristocratic and elitist. He has a truly </span><span class="c4 c5">dour</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c5">demeanour</span><span class="c4">. I don&rsquo;t quite understand his direction, nor his sentiment. I suppose it&rsquo;s one of conservatism and tradition&mdash; though, even amidst the oldest of the family, such a strict adherence to conservative principles is largely unfound! He is a peculiar figure, truly I tell you. His cold nature makes for a difficulty to read his expression. I myself have spoken to him for naught but a nonce. Extremely reclusive, he occupies himself totally within his own branch of the station. The </span><span class="c4 c5">Northern branch</span><span class="c4">. I don&rsquo;t suppose he be so willing to invite you all there. Most of his meetings with figures&mdash; he too, despite his nature, has been somewhat open to inviting certain figures to his station for talks&mdash; are contained within the western branches. Though, you are </span><span class="c4 c5">not </span><span class="c3">his typical figures of invite. In fact, from what I have read up about the Professor, he is not the most typical of people either&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;In any case, this makes me suspect he may be willing to invite you in some capacity to the Northern branch. In such a case, be extremely cautious with the manner of action you decide to take. He is incredibly sensitive to behavior.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Dreasnen looked down back at the leather brochure. His fingers wrapped tightly against the binding. &ldquo;So it is, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5">Thank you</span><span class="c3">, he added promptly, before ending the call. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It had not been a very long conversation, but he decided to head out. Upon leaving the chamber, he lifted the megala lens from his eyes, revealing a gaudy array of white lights whose gleam brushed against the entire room, awash in resplendence, the white steel and titanium blending all into a mix of white and silver-tinted dazzling colors which spilled out into his periphery. Standing awkwardly, he made some exercise of his eyes, moving them in arbitrary directions&mdash; they were strained. The visions of colors stayed in the same spot on his vision, shifting only slightly when he flashed his eyes toward various directions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let those eyes fall out,&rdquo; said a lame passerby official. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">He walked by quickly. When Dreasnen positioned himself into a more relaxed posture, he turned to face the direction of the man&mdash; he was gone. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dreasnen, to himself in a private smirk, made a joke of the man, in his head. He continued down the room. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The next morning had with it a rather putrid haze. It was not that it had any distasteful odour, but rather the tint with which the air floated was&mdash; to be utmost euphemistic&mdash; difficult to see through and evoked a sense of nausea. Being that we were inside a well-secured station, it really did bring to question just how &ldquo;secure&rdquo; things ran. Of course, perhaps one could not forevermore hide from the elements of space which collided and fell into another just outside the window. Truly, Dreasnen was witness to such splendid events. To catch a meteor fall into the embrace of another, melt in its impact, create a spark and then, only then, dissolve into its grace. To Dreasnen, such a fate was quite pleasuring. In such a flash, to melt, freeze, and dissolve into an impact&mdash; all within what appeared to him as merely half a second. Verily! he&rsquo;d tell himself, such is what true pleasure is! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">He walked down the hallway on the way to the ascensor. Spare me such a poor image of beauty and virile, that lengthening of pleasure with which man occupies himself! he mumbled to himself as he did so. Give me&hellip; he pressed the small button on the apparatus to request an elevation to the tenth floor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Grant me that flash of which a man desireth at the end of his silver thread! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The ascensor&rsquo;s doors opened outward, like the swinging doors of a quaint antique shoppe. See, the doors themselves too had that wooden texture and build, the windows on the doors, barred and all, with that same wintry fog and rime frost you&rsquo;d find on the month of an earthly December. He did not know why they&rsquo;d have the ascensor reflect such an outwardly and quite absurdly different aesthetic quality to the rest of the Station, but he did not mind. Though the frost had reminded him of one other detail:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;It seems it is quite below freezing in the upper floors,&rdquo; he noted, glancing at his watch which was set&mdash; at the moment&mdash; to display the various floors&rsquo; temperatures. And their climates. For, you must know, that each level, or floor whatever you may call it, had its own distinct environment and climate. This was for no unreasonable reason of course. Each level had to its own a very distinct and specialised zoological garden. And many, many botanical vivariums, very large each of them were, dedicated to the furthering of very miscellaneous and frankly unimportant research, it seemed to Dreasnen. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For all its intrigue, however, it was what least interested him at that moment, as the ascensor&rsquo;s doors had been just ajar. Rather, as he looked up from his watch, he noted just before him the Professor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Dreasnen, dearest. I was just here awaiting you on the ascensor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Is&mdash; Is that so? Then I apologise for my lateness,&rdquo; flustered Dreasnen, bowing slightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh no, no. Rather, I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re just about on perfect timing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Just then, the Professor&rsquo;s watch went off in a very pleasant alarm. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;See?&rdquo; He beckoned. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s go to the Baron.&rdquo; The alarm continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dreasnen walked into the ascensor, standing near to the Professor uncomfortably, in what was a rather snug fit, before the Professor silenced his watch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Quite the snug fit, eh?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dreasnen turned to glance at the Professor in response. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, I daresay </span><span class="c4 c5">too snug</span><span class="c3">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Mayhap.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The stood there briefly, for what felt like more than a couple of seconds. Though really only a flash of a mere half-second, he reflected, before he suggested:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Do I press the button?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh, do please. You know the floor?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; said Dreasnen. He began to reach out to the button; &ldquo;The tenth floor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;No, no, Dreasnen,&rdquo; he whispered, holding Dreasnen&rsquo;s arm. With a great grin, &ldquo;We are going to the twenty-second floor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was not that such brought him much joy. Nor did it bring him much of a shock. Rather, a little put off, he was only curious; he has never gone to such a floor as high as twenty-second. But really, he wondered, he really didn&rsquo;t even know such a floor even existed. Well, for one, while the station was certainly large and merited some expectation of a little over ten floors&hellip; twenty-two seemed a little preposterous. Not only that, there was no indication in the Professor to suggest it was even the </span><span class="c4 c5">highest</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;floor, but rather only the one in which they were to land. Of course, the professor was most certainly aware of Dreasnen&rsquo;s own ignorance, and so he broke into that wicked smile, but other than that, he didn&rsquo;t bear any fang which would suggest it being the highest. Though still, he was well aware of how </span><span class="c4 c5">long</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the station was, that most certainly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As they went upward, Dreasnen did imagine the station from the outside. Twenty-something floors at the very least, he though, and each floor has a ceiling so high one might fit three! What a wretched place should one call it home as I&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Dreasnen? Are you acquainted at all with the Baron?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Err&hellip; no, Professor. Though, I&rsquo;d not imagine you are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well, well, neither here, nor there, I suppose. He is quite the figure, I&rsquo;ve heard. Though only tales, only tales.&rdquo; He tapped Dreasnen with his elbow, &ldquo;Though very </span><span class="c4 c5">few</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;tales, mind you. The man himself is just that reclusive. I&rsquo;m sure you know of that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Well, yes I do. I was told of it. In fact,&rdquo; he continued, pulling out the brochure from the day before. &ldquo;I was given this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">He handed it to the Professor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh, here then we have&hellip;&rdquo; He looked closely, tapping that little contraption he called glasses, magnifying his vision. Though, he didn&rsquo;t seem to be reading it at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;The leather is of a unique kind,&rdquo; he concluded. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">He gave it back. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a book of ethics. Should they not have given you one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The Professor laughed, &ldquo;Oh, well, I guess not. Brings two to mind. Either I&rsquo;m so elegantly ethical in my conduct they saw unfit to give me such a brochure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; he said shrewdly, &ldquo;they see me so unfit as to receive one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dreasnen was a bit hesitant as to whether he was meant to laugh, or if the observation was an honest, pitiful one. Though the professor&rsquo;s face wizened with a smile. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so serious, Dreasnen.&rdquo; He struck Dreasnen with the cane he carried. &ldquo;Lest you make me think I really am such a pitiful man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It was not hard to read the Professor&rsquo;s banter. Though, with old men like he, one ought to be only so comfortable&mdash; it&rsquo;s better to tread with a shred of hesitancy and a deal of indifference. Any off expression could ruin the mood, he thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re pitiful, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The ascensor continued upward, flashing along the various floors, the windows gave a decent glance at their respective contents. Reaching the upper floors, the twenty-second floor, they stopped. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dreasnen and the Professor, Professor Calince, slipped and spilled out onto the large room. The hallway before them was all there was. There were no entrances to other rooms. Walking along, they saw, in their surroundings, the walls be not walls but great curved glass domes, each of which offered a view outward into space. It was the highest floor. At their feet, the floor itself was also glass. They appeared to be gazing straight downward into an aquarium of extraterrestrial aquatica. But again, at the dome above them, it was very dark. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Wear the megala.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Promptly, Dreasnen wore the megala which he had hung at his waistbelt. The Professor did not have the goggles, but rather had his glasses, with a lever&rsquo;s flick, cast out several peripheral apparati which formed something similar to the encasing lens found on the megala. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The inter-space above was so dimly dark, as it is with the goggles, that even the stars did not twinkle. Only did he get a slight blaze of light puddle through the left of his vision, which lightly limned the walls somewhat; that light was cast by the Star nearest; the Star they temporarily orbited; </span><span class="c4 c5">Hermes-1</span><span class="c4">. It was the first of its kind. A medium sized star, of no outstanding qualities. But a more markedly drifting star, which served as a proper point of reference for many a research on astronomical and stellar phenomena. For this reason, it was a popular hub of research facilities for its peculiar motion, elegant light, and highly volatile solar storms which provided many opportunities of study. Important messages came and went to this &ldquo;hub&rdquo; of sorts, all powered by the nearest Star, our messenger&mdash; </span><span class="c4 c5">Hermes-1</span><span class="c3">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5">Hermes-1</span><span class="c3">, in all its gaunt light, its pallid shine, filtered its glow through the darkened glass. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite nice, is it not? On the other floors, you do not get such a view of the Star as this. The station is angle such that the Star is on the ceiling&mdash; thus, only from the very highest floor can you see it right in front of you. Or, as closely in front as one can, as it is slightly timidly hugging the left of the ceiling.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Though the megala may have darkened the blinding white gleam of the Sun upon the glass, the immense radiance of warmth was not obscured. Its radiance was too great. The warmth was too great. He felt as though the pencil rays of light pooled upon his face&mdash; his cheeks and nose&mdash; filling their surface, now awash in a tawny sheen of heat and virile ecstasy. Verily, adorned in that bath of light through which children dance and run, it were as though that light, pallidly roseate upon their cheeks and nose and forehead, were laying upon them a crown of ivy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Men, are you here for the Baron?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Stolen from pleasant reverie, both men fell upon the grounding of the Station once again and saw a gentle figure, a man, right before them, in highly ornate dress. The clothing was fashionably antiquated, unsurprisingly, given the now known proclivities of the Baron. Dressed from head to toe in what could only be described as a very uniquely Victorian suit, one that one might see on a train conductor. A conductor&rsquo;s cap, beautifully stitched in Golden thread; too did he have the whiskering and splintered dangle of various soft silver and golden chains and knick-knack paraphernalia, keys and pocket-watches, which fell from his shoulders, his chest&rsquo;s pockets, belt, and the leather brim of his cap and the cuffs of his sleeves. One might imagine it would weigh on him, though the man did not seem to make any suggestion of an effort. The suit was a deep cerulean thick wool, too, unsurprisingly, given the temperatures at this part of the Station. The Professor and Dreasnen had to bear the colds for the nonce.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;For the Baron? Why, yes we are!&rdquo; the Professor sounded off with enthusiasm. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Then, upon this hall, right past the large doors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As he said, there were two large doors, wooden doors, not a part of the station, at the opposing end of the hall, where they&mdash; Dreasnen and the Professor&mdash; faced. Behind the man. It seemed the Baron had elected to directly station himself right against the upper docks. The dock of theirs&mdash; he and the Professor&rsquo;s station&mdash; was open, it seemed, to any. They, with great caution and care, walked along the floors, feeling a heavier air as they saw the man open for them those large wooden doors, and the heaviness of what seemed like the atmosphere one may feel along the edges of a forest, locked into the wooden scents and canopy coverings overhead. Even, though Dreasnen wondered if it were only a trick of his mind, some sounds of little creatures slipped through the doors. Chirps and other utterant quirks and the like. Cute little sounds. None of which he had heard before. They rang in his ear, leaving a marked impression, one of familiarity. The Baron, for all his eccentricities, appeared to be a man who adored that which was no longer. Such atmospheres as this, despite recreations in interior integrated biospheres, were of a distant, provincial garden, hidden against the capital of the Age today. Of course, it was more than obvious the Baron himself had never seen such natural scenes before either. This&mdash; and by this, one means that which Dreasnen and the Professor gazed upon entrance into the Station. Gnarls of trees and beds of moss, sounds of creatures, smells of earth, all organised chaotically into a splendid scene&mdash; was only merely his representations, projections of his, in a sort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Their boots sank into the bed of earth and moss, into plants and flowers, fallen, wilted petals and withered leaves. All around them was the revelation of life, the eternality, the unbecoming and becoming. Truly, before them there was the rot of wood and the flowering of fruit, fawning at their light steps. Verily, verily, this is not metaphor or hyperbole. For what Dreasnen and the Professor saw engaged them so deeply&mdash; simply put, before them, as clear as was possible, it appeared that time moved in sped up succession, so quickly that trees would rot and fall, and new seedlings would sprout and enwrap themselves in thick bark in their place, all in only a matter of a minute or so. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The grass and moss at their feet would wither and acquiesce. There was the delightful synthesis of birth and demise, which wrapped into one another around them. The gaunt dress of leaves were hung delicately upon the palish, soft branches, whose bark fell apart and enwrapped themself. Everything occurred off tempo, so that all at once one was simultaneously embellished by life and sanctified in death. If one watched closely too, one would find all around them that even the creatures could not escape. In eternal recurrence, their flesh turned putrid, and&mdash; from within&mdash; the flesh would stretch grotesquely outward, like a cocoon, before another creature, completely unrelated to the previous, would emerge in a mess of blood and seminal fluid which dragged at the creature&rsquo;s fur as it was born as though a butterfly from a caterpillar&rsquo;s flesh; or more precisely, as when a parasite eats out from within the host creature. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Men, please continue.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dreasnen and the Professor waded along the path shown to them&mdash; in fact, they noted that they indeed followed a natural path which was carved out in the nature, which was slowly being consumed in weeds, dandelions, thistles, and rapeseeds., all about. The way they formed into place was ecstatically bizarre, as they seemed to spiral around Dreasnen and the Professor, following their steps. The path took longer to be totally dissolved into plants before all wilting off one by one, and Dreasnen, in surprise, asked the man:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;And the path, does it always show?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh, no, sir. When everything is reborn, it occurs just slightly differently than it had the time previous, and so and on so forth. Never do the two quite match up in perfection. Certain details are lost and so it wanders toward some way that it prefers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;And so the path is not the same as before?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Correct, Mr. Dreasnen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;And so how do you know the path, then.&rdquo; Dreasnen looked back a the expanse they had crossed. It was no small room, it was rather large. In fact, the detail was omitted, but the walk through the room, if one could call it that, was about ten minutes. More than enough time for one to get lost.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You </span><span class="c4 c5">don&rsquo;t</span><span class="c3">, Mr. Dreasnen. Only the staff have memorised a general direction. But even then, we&rsquo;ve had staff fall into perplexion, become lost. Of course, inevitably they find their way. It&rsquo;s only a matter of searching enough, but one always finds their way. Do not be consumed by what goes on around, because the forest always changes, about ten times during the walk. The key, Mr. Dreansnen, is to move, while being unmoved. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;In other words, might I add, it is not good to use one&rsquo;s surroundings in the forest as a signpost of progression&mdash; lest you only aid in deceiving yourself further.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At the end of the forest was a metal door. On the door, he turned a watertight hatch wheel, opening the door. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;You know, it never occurred to me,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;It never did occur to me why Baron Leasneare was always so fond of the display.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5">Personally, I find it to be distasteful in scope and idea. But, each to their own</span><span class="c4">, he said. </span><span class="c4 c5 c6">But such a poor display of life is sure to be hay in my eye.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">They continued down the halls, which were lined in erudite wooden walls, smelling of parchment and bronze metal. The floors were silver. They were Delphic, beaming with sparkles and gleams of light which were reflected from the above swinging lights&mdash; electric lamps which hovered on their own above, not </span><span class="c4 c5">swinging </span><span class="c4">per se, but rather jittering in place, creating an illusion of a natural lilting motion. The silver seemed strange in its whisperish burnish, as though each lull of light whose reflection was cast alongside their own silhouettes were breaths of prophecy&mdash; their shadows swirled and surfaced, billowing out and within the silverish floors, akin to the frothing and churning of fate-bound figures in a clairvoyant&rsquo;s crystal. </span></p></body></html>
