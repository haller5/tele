</head><body class="c9 doc-content"><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She had been brought a week ago. Her ears were too large on her head, and they pointed outward in such an awfully awkward manner. Broken earrings in silver coat tugged from her earlobes, of which they were tainted a faint green hue. She had thin dark hair laying flat along her head, bangs which cut too close to her eyes and irises which were too dark. Her lips were solemn and thin, her chest and neck were mottled in patches of red hue, though her skin was not very pale, but had some colour to it, like light wood. She had been brought a week ago, on thursday. She had lost both parents in what was suggested to be a tragic accident. Though other than the immediate details of her delivery to the house, there was nothing more; she had only lost her parents, one had to go off of. Tragically, one would suppose. Even if not tragic, she rather gave the appearance of it, as she appeared to be in mourning&mdash; she came dressed in a black, small gown. She seemed no more than nine years of age. She had polished leather boots with droplets from the rain outside that day on that thursday. The door she knocked upon had not been knocked on for many years, and was rotting from within, only no one had bothered to care. Behind her, the cobblestone path led into a sombre car, a long car, shining in the moonlit night&mdash; the stars were hidden that night in thick mist and humid air. The windows were too darkly tinted. Lanterns adorned the sides of the path, though their luminance was too weak to be of any aid in discerning the young girl&rsquo;s short silhouette at the steps. She looked up at the family&mdash; a mother, a father, and a young nine year old daughter&mdash; in complete silence, and her eyes betrayed no sentiment, good or ill-intentioned. She had been brought the week past, somehow the time seemed much greater than this. In the great house, the manor, the great grandfather clock rang at intervals. The two young girls played with pallid dolls in the pale, gaunt moonlight which bathed the dark wooden steps beneath the large ceiling window. Rain crashed above, and the trees swayed. </span></p></body></html>
