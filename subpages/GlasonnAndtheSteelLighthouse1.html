Within the coming weeks, if I am to recall correctly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do we not have some&hellip;&rdquo; Drinking the tea, he searched around the room. It was made of a thick steel&mdash; the walls. Large windows were scattered around, though the night was black against the sky, with only the dotted milky array of stars forming any light against it. &ldquo;Some, oh you know, some calendar&mdash; it slipped my mind. Do we have one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, no we do not.&rdquo; He paced around the room, carrying a napkin on his forearm. His long boots tapped against the wooden floor as he walked toward the door. Opening the great steel door, held closed by a mechanical contraption, he departed, before popping in briefly: &ldquo;You had torn them all.&rdquo; He left.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had torn them all, yes. He remembered. Though not why. Stuck in the labyrinth of steel, in an entirely remote area, he was on a rather small and aloof island, surrounded only by the strong ocean. He sat in silence, with the silent sough of the sea filling his ears, though muffled by the steel walls.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How much longer will the summer be?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;How much longer will the summer be?&rdquo; He pulled at his collared shirt as he began to sweat. The room which he sat in, legs up on the table, was garishly lit with a bright white lamp hung from the ceiling, made to be reminiscent of a traditional chandelier, though it had more the silhouette of a jungle of industrial pipes, from which spherical electrical bulbs dangled, swinging lightly. He put his cup down, standing up. Walking around, in boots and all, he pulled off his tie placing it down on the large velvet couch near him. His face flushed and his ears burned red as he walked around, large wooden closets dug into the walls, he walked around, circling the table, looking out through the windows as he held his head in place, the room swirling quickly about him in a glowing blur of light. He dug at his eyes, he held his hair, covering his ears before falling against the window.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drussock! Drussock, I&rsquo;ve fallen! I&rsquo;ve fallen ill! God, this heat! Drussock, please!&rdquo; Glason&rsquo;n held onto the window sill, frigid, heaving himself upward and opening the window. Heavy, large brumal winds cascaded through the opening, pushing him back with strong force. His hair was being swept along the motion of the wind, his nose and ears were mottled in red as the cold scraped at his face.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Drussock came through the door, hastily making his way toward Glason&rsquo;n who was near fallen over, but sat on his knees.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir Glason&rsquo;n! Sir, what happened? What happened, Sir?&rdquo; He held Glason&rsquo;n and laid him onto the ground. &ldquo;Oh, stay here for a moment, do not move!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He went out and came back with a towel, drenched in cold water, and placed it on Glason&rsquo;n&rsquo;s brow. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said with a whisper, &ldquo;what did you do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I tell you, Drussock! This heat, it is this </span><span class="c3">heat!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but I am burning! I feel so sick.&rdquo; He took a deep breath and his gaze was lost in the steel beams running across the ceiling. &ldquo;I think I must take a step outside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, please do not. The tide is incredibly strong at night, and it&rsquo;s much too incredibly dark as well. We&rsquo;ve not even charted a fraction of the island. You&rsquo;ve no idea how dangerous it is. And, though hot in here, it is freezing out there, as the winds are bitterly cold, I tell you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drussock, don&rsquo;t stop me. And regardless, the island is quite small, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll have no problem, I promise. I may seem to be in no shape, but if you make any attempts to stop me, I will have to simply fight you to get outside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Drussock sighed, looking closely at Glason&rsquo;n. Glason&rsquo;n didn&rsquo;t look back, but seemed lost in thought. Drussock laughed as he stood up. &ldquo;Do as you will, sir. I&rsquo;ve no desire to stop you.&rdquo; Glason&rsquo;n smiled as Drussock left the room. He had forgotten to close the window. The chandelier swung more violently through the night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n did not step out immediately. He fell asleep. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few hours had passed before he was awake again. The room was still bright; the window was still open, too. He was laid against the wooden floor, near the large mosaic rug. He sat up and tucked his woollen trousers into his polished leather boots. Standing up, he reached toward the closet nearest him. He pulled a matching overcoat and tightened a belt over the waist&rsquo;s straps. He looked out through the window, before closing it. On his way out he grabbed his Inverness cape from a large black aluminium stand against the wall near the door, along with his cane which was a dark navy colour. Walking down the hallway, he noticed the relative cool air which brushed through the tight corridor. The walls were steel as well, with the floor being a carpeted floor with abstract post-modern cubist art. It was a striking beige against the grey walls. He made his way down the spiral stairway, from which many corridors extended at the various floors. Descending the long flight of stairs left him lethargic and he began to notice his feeling resembling that of a feverous dream. His steps felt a little too light to be his and his cane dragged behind his steps. Reaching the bottom he searched for a bathroom, desperately. He was in the large living room near the entrance. Large pillars towered and romanesque architecture made the room seem like a dreadfully tasteless chamber. He scampered along the lurid carpeted floor and velveted furniture over through to the bathroom on the far end. Taking his towel in hand, he ran it under the cold water, soaking it entirely, before placing it on his forehead, underneath his hair. He held his chin slightly pointed upward as he searched the drawers and cabinets for some gauze dressings to keep it in place. As he did so, he began to listen to the surrounding, as the main chamber grew alive in whispers of music. He stayed silent, crouched against the cabinets, listening closely, as he heard orchestra through the walls, only in the very distance, though it had a strong presence, as it seemed to emanate from the walls themselves and not some singular source, not some radio or other device. Slowing down, he reached into one of the lower cabinets, keeping his gaze out toward the entrance to the restroom, as his fingers grazed upon what he perceived to be bandages. He pulled them close and applied them to the towel&mdash; wrapped haphazardly across his head and covering his right eye&mdash; to keep it in place. He looked in the mirror in front of him and patted his hair down against his ears and listened intently.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">What is that sound? Surely it can&rsquo;t be Drussock! It is late&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He sauntered along the marble floors, carefully stepping so as not to make great noise with his boots. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Drussock! Drussock! What is with this whisper I hear?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cold streams of water seeped from the towel, running down his cheeks and nose. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drussock!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Are you playing any music?&rdquo; He called out from within the bathroom, with only a slight crack of light slipping through the bathroom door which was left fractionally ajar. &ldquo;Druss&hellip;&rdquo; Meandering aimlessly in a sort of relaxed motion, he circled the various furniture and quarters of the main chamber, following the sound which appeared to have no source, whispering back at him in the same volume from each end of the room. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">What could this be? But if not my imagination, then it must&hellip; it must be my imagination? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He decided to continue with his objective of stepping outside and directed his gaze toward the daunting wooden door, shut with golden locks and chains. Walking on the heels of his boots to prevent any loud noises, he reached the door. At the entrance, where the carpeted floor ended and switched to a dark wood, he saw his large steel helmet. Shaped in a peculiar blend of steel and aluminium, it was a roughly moulded spherical shape, rusted on its sides and with one large circular opening for the left eye, where the right eye was welded shut. It was an old prisoner&rsquo;s iron mask, used for those condemned to life sentences. As such, made for humiliative purposes, the helmet was adorned with a wooden crown of thorns, fastened into place by welded rings of iron which held the wood in place. Though for him, he made great use of it many times. He found it long ago, when he first arrived here, in the lower basement chamber of the lighthouse. The entire room had naught but the lonely helmet. He used it for the strong, biting winter winds, though it really was not winter, he thought. It was summer. Midsummer, maybe. But this close to the sea it seemed the seasons truly did not matter when it came to the night. He wore the helmet and stepped outside. It was completely dark as he spitter-spattered down the steps in a sort of tap dance rhythm, though of course he wasn&rsquo;t dancing, but was really tapping at the rhythm of his hesitancy, lilting up and down the flight of stairs. If not for his timid sound&mdash; awfully resounding as the steps were steel&mdash; the surrounding forest of trees had near fallen to a total lull, with only the occasional bird chirping here and there. The flight of stairs was a singular set, though on the second landing it split into two, going in opposite diagonal directions, with a large bronze statue of a man, aloof and inquisitive toward the ground, sat against nothing. Glason&rsquo;n hurried past the statue, paying it no mind but a glance, enough to see that the bronze was quite new, really. It was not weathered in the slightest, which left him with a similarly inquisitive gesture upon his face as he descended. His cane banged against the steps and his cape caught the wind. He was a rattle of trinkets and other curios, military medals and golden discs, silver flags and arrows, chains and locks, all attached to his coat and cape in helpless hazardous ways. Reaching the foot of the stairs he stopped suddenly. The music was much quieter now, too; though&mdash; suspiciously&mdash; he still heard it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is quite cold, he thought. The wind was very cold and very strong, and though the moonlight was obscured by thick clouds, his iron helmet glinted shyly. He trodded onward through the thicket, passing against brambles and rabbits which hid within them. He could hear the silent scurry of rustling leaves and bouncing steps as small animals fled from his steps. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wonder how large the island is?&rdquo; he whispered to himself. &ldquo;Drussock had told me there had been no maps of the place when we arrived. Still, I find that&hellip;&rdquo; He glanced back at the steel lighthouse structure. It had a funny silhouette, nothing like that of an old lighthouse. It was far too strange, with hallways jutting out, floating parts which one could only wonder for eternity how they were held up without any support. It&rsquo;s silhouette was more like that of a very large gnarled tree. A tree made of thick steel pipes, circular or rectangular. It ran with steam&mdash; that is, a boiler deep within the lower chambers of the lighthouse; below the ground. It powered the entire building. From the back, near the left of the building, smoke could be seen billowing from a chimney which ran along its side walls. He could see his room toward the top, radiantly apparent, with an enamel glow from the window now closed. &ldquo;Still, I find that to be a little odd, if not ridiculous. Truly, Drussock may have not looked.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">He darted around as he heard crackling around him. &ldquo;Though&hellip;&rdquo; he continued, cautiously afraid, &ldquo;it couldn&rsquo;t be that he is </span><span class="c3">hiding</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it from me, could it? Drussock could never do such a thing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He saw a black rabbit hurry quickly. It was endearing, but he was quickly taken aback by the boldness of the rabbit to pass under his legs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; he yelled, trying to kick the rabbit away. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; The rabbit stopped abruptly, behind him. &ldquo;You stupid rabbit&hellip; I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d know your way through the island.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">The rabbit was briefly stationed as though he was listening intently. Sort of like a little furry soldier of sorts, trained in an army, he thought. He smiled, </span><span class="c3">what an imagination!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;He bent over quite straight, his head just over the rabbit. The thing, the rabbit, looked back quite cutely with its large varnished green eyes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Follow me</span><span class="c6">, it said. It didn&rsquo;t really. But Glason&rsquo;n pretended it did. </span><span class="c3">I know a place, one which you have sought for a very long time</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh really,&rdquo; he said in sarcastic disbelief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no reason to believe you, rabbit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Then don&rsquo;t believe me. Follow me</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Clever. I shall follow you.&rdquo; He chased after the rabbit, to which the rabbit responded by fleeing very quickly. Glason&rsquo;n did keep up a speed for a fair length of the way. &ldquo;Truly, I know not where you take me! But I know you tell the truth, rabbit!&rdquo; </span><span class="c3">Even though you may not really be talking</span><span class="c0">, he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Time for a name! Like any new animal, a man must give you a name.&rdquo; Sprinting at his maximum speed, he began to feel incredibly lethargic, his heart raced and he was gasping for air. &ldquo;A name&hellip;&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he brushed against the thorny undergrowth and began to descend further into what seemed like the more dark and sinister parts of the island. &ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; he took his arm, which was cut through the fabric of the cape and coat. &ldquo;Okay, okay. The name&hellip; the name&hellip; I think your name shall be&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tripping against a thick growth of large tree roots he plummeted toward the ground with a heavy thud, his head dashed against more tree roots with a large metallic bang as it hit his iron helmet. Not terribly athletic, he had no stamina to continue further, or any willpower to get up. He rolled across onto his back and, looking up toward where the rabbit ran, he saw through the eye opening a faint blur of black and&mdash; gone. The rabbit was gone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He breathed heavily, shallow breaths before he recovered briefly, sitting up. He still held his right arm with his left. He uncovered the torn fabric revealing an ugly gash and very dark blood glistening on his hand. It seemed to have no colour, and appeared to be utterly monochrome. &ldquo;The name,&rdquo; he said between breaths. &ldquo;Maybe Arckessat.&rdquo; He fell back and leaves fluttered up beside him. Fireflies twirled in dancing motion over his face. It looked a little surreal from within his metal mask. He heard only his mostly muffled breaths before he retained some hearing again. &ldquo;Drussock&hellip; oh, Drussock, you were right. I should have just stayed home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He regained his posture and dusted himself off. In front of him, not far off where the rabbit had disappeared he noticed a small sparkling glint of metal underneath the moonlit sky. It was enshrouded in dark verdant shrubbery and poisonous ivy and vines.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, then,&rdquo; he said. He was wearing gloves, however they were thin leather gloves. He was hesitant to touch the plants, but decided that it shouldn&rsquo;t really matter. The metal appeared to be attached to an even larger structure. A very much larger structure, and his hand appeared to be grabbing some sort of hatch, some handle of sorts. He placed both hands firmly on the cold handle and pulled, the heels of his boots firmly dug into the soil. &ldquo;Ope&mdash;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The handle pulled loose and came off clean and the hatch opened up, revealing a wooden ladder which led downwards. He peered over, throwing the handle aside, and saw nothing but a dark void with not a twinkle of a moth or lonely insect. He looked to his surroundings to be sure he was alone before stepping onto the ladder. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was still above the ground, but descended further until he heard that peculiar voice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You! You there, with the strange helmet on!&rdquo; it called.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&hellip; what. Uhm. Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Glason&rsquo;n called. &ldquo;You sound strange and, frankly&hellip; oh, I don&rsquo;t intend to be rude&mdash; but you sound fat!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No bother, but what are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh me! I was only&hellip;&rdquo; he climbed out, up the ladder. &ldquo;I was only, you see&mdash; leaving!&rdquo; He started in a quick heavy dash, but really he could not see a thing. He wondered briefly about the fat man, and whether he was a bit too blunt about the whole thing before he tripped on the same tree root and slammed his head against the ground.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Was that you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n lay unconscious on the ground for a few seconds before blinking back into a slightly awaken state. He rolled onto his back to see a stout, round (fat, as Glason&rsquo;n suggested) man. Hardly a man, too, more of a dwarf, a goblin-like thing. Awfully hairy and with really chubby hands. His feet appeared to be bursting out his well-polished shoes and his stomach at the seams of his clearly humble dress, which consisted of a white sailor&rsquo;s shirt and some navy shorts.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, man. Or&hellip; sorry for&hellip; thing?&rdquo; he paused, blinking blankly at the man. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Nothing. What do </span><span class="c3">you </span><span class="c6">want, you came running through this here path wildly! What are </span><span class="c3">you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; that is a good question.&rdquo; He turned to his side. &ldquo;What </span><span class="c3">is </span><span class="c0">this thing? Really it is quite ugly, I should tell Drussock to watch for it. Or, better yet, we can hunt this thing down and hang it up in the lighthouse as a sort of prize. It will be delightful, I think Druss&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He turned to face the man. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;what&rsquo;! That thing&hellip; whatever you were muttering to yourself just then, what did you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; He threw himself at Glason&rsquo;n and began to strangle him. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n struggled greatly. He wasn&rsquo;t particularly athletic, clearly. But given the size difference he was able to turn things around and have the goblin beneath him. They both breathed quickly as they faced each other. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, you were gonna kill me. That weird mutter you did to yourself, you talked to yourself as if I wasn&rsquo;t right in front of you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. I do get a bit lonely, I suppose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Whatever! Let me go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why not!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You tried to choke me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, can we stop this here. I don&rsquo;t want to die, I really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He began to tear up and cry. &ldquo;Please! Please sir&hellip;&rdquo; He opened one eye.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Glason&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir Glason&rsquo;n, have mercy!&rdquo; He continued crying.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay. But&hellip; answer me this,&rdquo; said Glason&rsquo;n, turning to his side. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">I wonder where this thing is from. It seems to be a native species.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;What are you? How long have you been here, what do you know of this island?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A fair bit of questions. I&rsquo;m Stalenaire, an abandoned sailor. I&rsquo;ve been here about&hellip;&rdquo; he struggled again, trying to choke Glason&rsquo;n. Glason&rsquo;n maintained the upper hand in the whole ordeal again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop it! You won&rsquo;t win, you mongrel!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mongrel? What are you saying, what do you think I am? I&rsquo;m a human, don&rsquo;t be so rude! Just a little roughed up. I have been here for about a decade.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A decade?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thirty six maybe, I&rsquo;m not very sure. Have you got a calendar?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No. And what a strange question, almost taunting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. Still, as for your last question, I know the island quite well. Not </span><span class="c3">so</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;well, but a fair deal. It is very big, I tell you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fine enough. Your answers are fine enough. Though your name is a bit unsavoury. May I call you something else?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Help me out here. Maybe&hellip; something like&hellip; Stal!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stal? Well, yeah I&mdash; that could work as a nickname.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I must take you back to Drussock, regardless. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d be interested in you.&rdquo; He stood up, releasing Stal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drussock? The madman hunter you spoke of just a moment ago?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh no, he&rsquo;s no hunter. Don&rsquo;t worry, Stal. He&rsquo;s my butler, I think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A butler?&rdquo; he replied, standing up. They walked forward, alongside each other.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. I was contracted, along with him, to work at the lighthouse over summer, fall, winter, until winter&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only in summer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Precisely, and I already dread the rest of the year.&rdquo; He turned to face Stal, who was considerably shorter than he was. &ldquo;You must know, I have a great trouble sleeping. Some insomnia, it is. Truly makes the days feel like a year, and minutes like days. And the few sleep I do get, those dreams blend all too much with reality. I have some trouble distinguishing between real and not.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And that helmet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just a helmet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. And this lighthouse?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Up there,&rdquo; he said, pointing with a subtly limp finger. The ring over his gloved finger glinted in the moonlight. And behind the gloved hand lay the large dark silhouette of the lighthouse, which hardly looked as such. It loomed over the island; or at least their part of it. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like a lighthouse at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; They walked carefully past the growth of trees and shrubs. Glason&rsquo;n wondered momentarily about the black rabbit. &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; He looked over to Stal, smiling. &ldquo;But who&rsquo;s to say what&rsquo;s a lighthouse and not. All it needs is that beaming light.&rdquo; They looked up at the lighthouse, and sure enough the large beaming shaft of light cast its radiant glow across the ocean, spinning slowly. Around the light&rsquo;s silhouette they could see small birds gathered around the white light, fluttering in and out. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Stal?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nevermind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing, it just slipped my mind.&rdquo; He thought about the ladder leading down. He was convinced there was something on the island. He decided he&rsquo;d head out to see it during the day. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Drussock mustn&rsquo;t know about this. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to have him worry. I&rsquo;ll keep it all in my head. Or better yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n stopped abruptly and sat on the ground. Stal stopped. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Give me a moment.&rdquo; He pulled out a miniature notebook from his coat and a pen hung on the collar of his cape. &ldquo;I need to write this before I forget.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Forget what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Too many questions. Besides, I can&rsquo;t tell you just yet. Turn around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal turned around. He took a look at where the light pointed toward. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, sir Glason&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have you ever seen any ship at all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t step out often.&rdquo; He continued scribbling down notes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So you haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal sat down, facing away. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stal?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t bring you to Drussock,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I need you for something. Would you mind sleeping in the basement for a bit?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He stuffed the notebook and pen into his coat and they continued along. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The basement, really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Precisely. It&rsquo;s quite comfortable, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They reached the foot of the stairs not long after. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stal. Take this.&rdquo; He pulled out a twelve gauge, double barreled pistol adorned with golden rings and chains. It even had a watch awkwardly taped onto the top, along both barrels. &ldquo;Keep this. I&rsquo;ll need you to use it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal took it in his hand. The beam of light passed right over them as they went up the stairs. As it did, the silver barrel shimmered in white.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chapter Two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel awfully tired, though I didn&rsquo;t sleep more than perhaps an hour or two. In fact, I might say I feel even quite refreshed. Wouldn&rsquo;t you say? Don&rsquo;t I look mighty well!&rdquo; He looked directly at the stuffed rabbit on his bed. &ldquo;I know you agree, you mustn&rsquo;t say a word for me to know. I can read your mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir Glason&rsquo;n.&rdquo; Drussock came quite suddenly through the door. &ldquo;Good morning Glason&rsquo;n, how was your night?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;More spectacular than you can imagine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Drussock eyed Glason&rsquo;n with some curiosity. &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh yes, Drussock. I must tell you all about it over dinner!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Drussock smiled. &ldquo;Alright then. I&rsquo;ll leave you to yourself for now.&rdquo; He picked up the dishes from the day before and left.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n followed not long after, hearing his faint steps. He walked down onto the first floor, and descended further into the base floor&mdash; the basement of the lighthouse. No one entered the basement, as it was dimly lit and really quite frightening. It was maze-like, with countless shelves filled with books and boxes and all the like. Glason&rsquo;n could see nothing but the dim light emanating from a lone electric bulb above dangling dangerously from a single thread of wire. Moths gathered around the light, their shadows dappled against the walls of the basement, forming huge black grotesque silhouettes fluttering in and out of position. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n crept close to the ground, eyeing small insects gathered at the crevices of the rotten wooden floor. Beside him he noticed a strange rapier, and took note of it. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stal!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Stal, it is day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He held along to the shelves, moving through. &ldquo;Stal, it is morning!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal appeared lying down beneath the light, though he faced away from it. He looked a little adorably lying down there, if he weren&rsquo;t so fat. His face was washed in the white splendour, Glason&rsquo;n wondered how the gaudy flash of the light didn&rsquo;t bother him at all, as he appeared to sleep awfully soundly. Glason&rsquo;n gathered more closely beside Stal. He saw the pistol lying by his side. Stal blinked once, twice, thrice! before he awakened in a weary and sudden surprise.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh sir Glason&rsquo;n! What do you&hellip;&rdquo; He yawned very loudly. &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I could ask you the same thing! It is near mid-day really. Or morning, I haven&rsquo;t checked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal looked at the watch on the pistol. &ldquo;Seems it is half past ten.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh that watch is slightly off, ignore it. Might be eleven in actuality,&rdquo; nodded Glason&rsquo;n. &ldquo;But back to our business. I do not know you very well, as I&rsquo;m sure you are aware.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal nodded with an intent and wide eyed gaze. He didn&rsquo;t seem to be paying much attention. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n clasped his hands together. &ldquo;So, you must know&hellip; I cannot trust you a great deal&hellip; yet!&rdquo; He smiled, standing up straight. &ldquo;Yesterday&hellip; when I first encountered you. I was struck a bit by a discovery I had not any intention of making.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">He paced around Stal with a certain air of superiority. &ldquo;And&hellip; you had found me just then when I had begun my descent. You seemed to notice me on the ladder. But you were not at all curious about the ladder at all. It is with such logic that I&hellip; conclude that you were previously aware of the ladder, or even what it </span><span class="c3">led</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to.&rdquo; He looked at Stal with a furrowed brow. Lowering himself to Stal, he continued: &ldquo;Is that not right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal was still lying down looking up at Glason&rsquo;n. At the question he sat up quickly, understanding what Glason&rsquo;n was asking. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stal. I need you to accompany me to the ladder. I need you to tell me what you know about the ladder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything. I&rsquo;ve come across it. It first appeared maybe a year ago. Or it was there before then, I think. But that is when I first encountered it. Last summer, I know it was summer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know anything?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. Well, I went down the ladder. And it was too dark to see anything. I couldn&rsquo;t make out any detail. I do recall getting to a really large door. More like a steel gate. But there was nothing I could do to open it. I don&rsquo;t know how to open it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He thought for a moment. &ldquo;Stal. I believe you. Will you accompany me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s nothing! Why are you so interested in it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Do not be alarmed, but&mdash; and get closer for this, I assure you it&rsquo;s important&mdash; but&hellip; I am convinced&mdash; in fact, I </span><span class="c3">know</span><span class="c0">&mdash; that the island has some form of ominous energy to it. The nights have these wretched whispers which crawl out of the forest&rsquo;s lulls. I am attacked by sleepless nights, headaches, feverous dreams and hallucinations&mdash; I am quite well accustomed to them, but&hellip; dear, I sometimes lose myself in them! I hadn&rsquo;t been inflicted with such so greatly as when I got here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a little delusional to think so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s precisely it. I agree, don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t. My mind keeps me grounded, in what little capacity it can. And Drussock does as well. He tends to me often. But since I arrived, I felt in my soul, or heart, a deep burning sensation of something. I don&rsquo;t know quite what, but I feel myself victim to something divinely awful. A wrath beyond me, you see? I can no longer ignore it. I suppose I could be imagining it all, and trust me, I do think I am&hellip; but, simply because it is not going on materially, simply because I know it is in my head, I can not tell you for sure that it is not </span><span class="c3">real</span><span class="c0">. I tell you this because I am afraid it would do you no help to not know it from the get-go. But let me say one last thing before I make my request: what do you make of this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think you are both the wound and the blade.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n winced at the words. &ldquo;Harsh.&rdquo; He crouched before Stal. &ldquo;Will you accompany me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To the ladder?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To the ladder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal nodded. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n grinned, standing up and walking out of the labyrinth of shelves through the way he came. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will have brunch. Meet me at noon. I will bring you a meal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">As he walked along the thin corridors of the basement, he tripped over countless electrical wires in a bundle. He kneeled down, holding the wires in his palm. </span><span class="c3">We have no wires</span><span class="c0">, he thought. He followed them through the basement as they winded in and out of shelves, through cramped areas. They ended against a wall. Really they continued further, but through a small crevice in the wall. He smelled a strange chemical odour. It had a burnt smell. He looked around at the shelves. They were books on electrical engineering. Beside them he found a golden watch. The books were open but completely in dust.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll return.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He stormed out of the basement, reappearing into the living room. He looked around for Drussock. He did not call out to Drussock, but decided upon simply sitting at the dining table. He sat quietly, the chair feeling a little uncomfortable, though he managed. &ldquo;Drussock, Drussock!&rdquo; he mouthed. He didn&rsquo;t want to call him, but he was feeling that it was impertinent of Drussock to suggest brunch and not be here. Glason&rsquo;n decided on tending to the plants around the kitchen. The kitchen was large and primarily composed of steel and aluminium. It had a strange futuristic look, or at least what someone in the 19th century would think of the future. With the dazzle of traditional steam machinery and a gloss finish on the metal countertops. The kitchen was heavily adorned with beautiful flora. Glason&rsquo;n did not know where Drussock had got these plants. Whether they were here or he brought them, that he did not know. Though he never really thought about it, and decided not to then. As he watered the plants, cradled in crevices and tight spots, and others which swung from cabinet knobs. Others crawled across the walls. He went around, watering them, before he noticed a small portrait of Drussock. It had a nice frame, though there was no glass protecting the photograph. Glason&rsquo;n held the frame in his hand. He saw it was not just Drussock, but a woman too, who he assumed to be his wife. Drusssock came walking from behind, through the dining room. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir Glason&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Drussock.&rdquo; He looked at the portrait. &ldquo;Drussock, is this your wife?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Was </span><span class="c0">my wife, Sir Glason&rsquo;n. She passed away many years ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And her name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Audrienna.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;An odd name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not common, I agree.&rdquo; He walked up to Glason&rsquo;n. &ldquo;The photograph has no glass. Let&rsquo;s put it down for now. I&rsquo;ve had brunch prepared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He held Glason&rsquo;n&rsquo;s hands, guiding the photograph to its place. He walked Glason&rsquo;n over to the dining room. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Glason&rsquo;n. &ldquo;I recall passing through there and not seeing anything on the tables.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Drussock laughed. &ldquo;Oh no, Glason&rsquo;n. They were here. You may&rsquo;ve just lost your sense of smell!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash; I suppose so&hellip;&rdquo; Glason&rsquo;n sat down. He glanced at the food. They were hotcakes with banana bread. He had also been served his tea. &ldquo;Say, Drussock? Have you been to the basement?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I have. I keep a few things down there, and a few of yours. There&rsquo;s not a great amount of unused storage elsewhere?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n eyed Drussock, who ate his food. He too then turned to his food. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Drussock. I have not my notebook. So I shall write in my head for now. I&rsquo;ve encountered wires in the basement, of which I am greatly suspicious. Drussock has a wife, of which I was only marginally aware of. Drussock visits the basement. I am suspicious of the basement. I am suspicious of Drussock, though I hate to write this.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I must go outside next.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; said Drussock.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, sorry.&rdquo; Glason&rsquo;n faced down at his plate again. &ldquo;Excuse me for my impertinence, but I must leave for now, I will head outdoors to catch some air!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahh&hellip;&rdquo; Drussock saw Glason&rsquo;n&rsquo;s food unfinished. &ldquo;But your food?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll take it with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mhm&hellip; But don&rsquo;t go any further than the statue. I&rsquo;m aware you stepped out last night, don&rsquo;t go far. You may get lost, Sir Glason&rsquo;n!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, thank you Drussock!&rdquo; He took the plate and hurried outdoors. He had still a half hour until noon. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He paced around the stairs. He had not the slightest idea what to do in the meantime. He went back inside, but found Drussock was gone. Glason&rsquo;n noticed he left his own tea. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">I had been in such a hurry today&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He sat down alone to drink his tea. In the drink he noticed his reflection briefly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel too well. But I can&rsquo;t say I look terrible. In fact, I look quite great.&rdquo; He walked over to the unclean dishes and dumped the rest of the tea in the sink. &ldquo;I should get going to meet Stal,&rdquo; he muttered. Glason&rsquo;n looked around himself, listening to any spur of sound. &ldquo;If I get there early, no matter! There is that wretched ladder&hellip; I&rsquo;ll simply have to descend without him. It drives me insane&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He got up quickly and headed toward the basement, picking up the rapier he noticed earlier and passed it through one of the belt loop of his trousers. He then crossed toward the bathroom, wetting a towel for himself and repeating the same as the day before. He headed out, picking up his cane and helmet. The breeze was calm in the early morning, as calm as it gets on the coast of the island. Still the wind caught on his coat and threatened to knock him over. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had made it to the ladder in only the pass of several minutes, of which he ran a few. He wasn&rsquo;t far from the lighthouse. Not as far as he&rsquo;d anticipated, which only furthered his own suspicions. He sat down and jotted on his notebook. He&rsquo;d wait for Stal. He left the food on his lap.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there is something cruelly awful abound. The ladder acts as some transition to that, a deeper layer of understanding. While also of course being a deeper layer into the ground.&rdquo; He looked up at the horizon which peered behind the thick layer of trees around him. For how large the island was, it had a flat scenery toward the edges. He could see water gathering in on the sandy coast. He put his notebook back into his pocket before making sure his boots were secure and stuffing his trousers into them. Glason&rsquo;n laid down to look at the sky.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;May I be a fool? It could be dangerous. Or it could be nothing, as Stal says. I feel as though I&rsquo;m stepping into the layers of Inferno. Nothing great could come out of it. At the best, it&rsquo;ll be total disappointment, of which I am not too keen on it being. Really, I&rsquo;d rather prefer to die against some great beast. Then maybe it would have been worth it. Already I have gotten my hands dirtied in stepping into this muddled mess of who-knows? Only spilled blood can wash me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir Glason&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n looked up behind him as he was lying down. He saw Stal&rsquo;s round figure stood up quite still over him. &ldquo;Stal! You came, I was only just speaking nonsense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So the ladder?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, wait a moment. I did bring you food, you must be famished!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal sat with him eating the leftovers from a half hour ago. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why do you wear that helmet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This helmet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip; yes, I see no other helmet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fair. Well this helmet helps against the strong winds. Sometimes they pick up twigs and they go all about in a swirling storm. Wouldn&rsquo;t want to get knocked over!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mhm&hellip;&rdquo; Stal seemed displeased with the answer. &ldquo;But does it not obscure your vision?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hardly, dear Stal! A man doesn&rsquo;t see with his eyes, but a pulsing fire in his soul! My eyes really only hinder me. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll roam the lighthouse with a wet towel as a blindfold&mdash; primarily for my headaches&mdash; and simply prance about in that manner. My senses are altered, heightened, and a burning sense of goodness&hellip; that, whatever that is, I feel it in my heart. Not goodness in any traditional sense, I&rsquo;ve got no other word, really. But perhaps more like&hellip; a feeling of instinct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;One wouldn&rsquo;t really equate instinct with &lsquo;good&rsquo;, usually.&rdquo; Stal finished his food.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The layman would not. But it is both light and free.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Light?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Forget it, Stal. Time is important here.&rdquo; He stood up, looking through the single eye-socket in the helmet. He took to walking. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s descend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait! Wait! Glason&rsquo;n, wait! Have you no sort of sense of danger in this case!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I do. But I also brought this,&rdquo; he said, revealing the large pistol and rapier beneath his coat. He jumped and quickly descended with a flair of effortlessness down the ladder. Stal hurried clumsily after him, his heavy figure preventing such a graceful descent. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As they continued further down, the skylight above grew dim and they were in near-complete darkness. Only their faces were limned&mdash; hardly&mdash; by the natural light above.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stal, take out that pistol I had given you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal took out the pistol.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It has a light attached to it,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;It is a bit fragile so don&rsquo;t mess with it too much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The light turned on, casting a terrible white beam of light on the whole substructure they had found themselves in. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, Stal. Keep that thing steady&mdash; that gun you have.&rdquo; He looked at Stal. &ldquo;You are terribly underdressed for this. No matter, it&rsquo;s not as though I&rsquo;m so offended.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The area here seems to be quite ancient, but strangely modern in some ways. The architecture certainly is not any I&rsquo;ve&mdash;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What architecture is this?&rdquo; He walked around noticing the spherical vaults above, with their grand displays of symbols and carvings. The vaults were romanesque. &ldquo;The truly strange thing here is the material.&rdquo; The entire room was bronze. The pillars, the stairs, the balustrades. It was not an appealing texture, in fact the lurid gleam of bronze hurt his head and caused his head to rush. He slowed down, facecatching his breath. He could feel his face flush in blood. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gah, Stal! Stal, keep the light off of me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He fell to the ground, pulling off his metal helmet. Glason&rsquo;n started to cough horribly, covering his mouth with his coat. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Glason&rsquo;n? Sir Glason&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n quickly waved him away, crawling forward. He dropped his head to the ground. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stal. Stal, do you have water?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That is fine. That&rsquo;s fine, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He pulled the coat back from his mouth, revealing a dark blood stain. &ldquo;Okay. Okay, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir Glason&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, I am fine.&rdquo; He stood up. He pulled out the rapier, holding it steady in front of him. &ldquo;Okay. We can continue.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The room, bronze, with its great architecture scintillating beneath the thin beam of light coming from Stal&rsquo;s pistol, had a peculiar feeling to it. To Glason&rsquo;n it felt as though the walls breathed, they came close and pulled back, like one&rsquo;s chest, heaving back and forth. The towering ceiling did not make the structure feel any less closed or claustrophobic.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you feel it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The what, sir?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The room&rsquo;s alive&hellip;&rdquo; he whispered. He paused, listening reticently. There was no sound. &ldquo;You may not feel it.&rdquo; He kept low to the ground, as a bird stitched its way across the room, flashing its wings. &ldquo;But I do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal followed closely behind Glason&rsquo;n, illuminating him from behind and the path before him. The structure was sublime, Glason&rsquo;n could feel it, it had a profound effect on him. He could feel the walls pressing in on his flesh. He could feel his muscles tighten. As he walked, the resounding steps of his boots caused a deeply sincere sense of awe, as they echoed throughout. But still, the room was quite empty, containing nothing. The floor was what caught his eyes, if anything. It had an alchemical design, with astronomical designs of stars, calculating their position. The heavens, the earth, and the Sun in the middle. The Sun, as with many older mediaeval designs, had an awful grin, all too human in presentation. Around the entire thing were the various moon phases, circling the centre design. Etched onto the bronze, but the bronze here was painted, or simply an entirely different material, as they were resplendent in colour, beautifully brilliant. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The door, Stal. Look at the door.&rdquo; In front of Glason&rsquo;n stood the great door. It had countless contraptions which kept it shut, moving about like gears and knobs, fluttering and whizzing. The ghost-breathing and whisking of metal, it had a hollow, timid sound.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You said you couldn&rsquo;t open it. But I think I know how to open it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal reached closer to Glason&rsquo;n. The light shined against Glason&rsquo;n&rsquo;s shoulder. From where Stal stood, the light had a terrible glare on Glason&rsquo;n&rsquo;s rapier, which flashed in all directions. The flash illuminated the wall, which had&mdash; upon it, deeply engraved&mdash; several characters going along vertically. They did not belong the Latin alphabet, but were something else entirely. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How will you open it?&rdquo; whispered Stal, his breath muggy against Glason&rsquo;n&rsquo;s neck. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n saw a large sculpture standing on one end of the door, opposite of its hinges. He walked up to it. It was a figure of a man, large but not bronze. The sculpture was in fact silver, or some other silverish metal. The man was in an awkward stance, his hands clasped together, his legs apart. It gazed out blankly past them. Stal turned, circling around, flashing the light at Glason&rsquo;n from the side. He saw Glason&rsquo;n with a sultry gaze directed at the statue, and his nose was flushed with red. When Stal redirected the light toward the statue, it was utterly washed in white, blinding both of them. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We have to leave, Stal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n looked at the rapier in his hand. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t suppose&hellip;&rdquo; He looked at Stal. &ldquo;No, of course not. Or could it?&rdquo; He turned to the statue, and reached up toward its arms, laying the rapier upon its open palms. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Drussock, you bastard! You hide these wretched secrets from me in these arcane tunnels. What of this! Drussock, I&rsquo;m certain it&rsquo;s you. It couldn&rsquo;t be Stal. Could it be Stal? I&rsquo;ve not thought about it much, but he has got too weak a shape to be responsible. He&rsquo;s got too weak of a spirit, I sense no will in him. Indeed, in you Drussock, I do not sense much either, but that silence you have&mdash; that gives me all the more reason to suspect such a chasm of secret as this</span><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...to be yours&hellip;&rdquo; he spoke to himself.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Glason&rsquo;n? Sir Glason&rsquo;n are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Oh, yes&hellip;! Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip; you see you look terribly pallid and weak, your legs are trembling awfully!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Glason&rsquo;n&rsquo;s legs </span><span class="c3">were</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;trembling awfully, unsupported by his cane which he had dropped on the ground just a moment before. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, yes; I am very much alright, thank you.&rdquo; He reached for the cane, supporting himself once more. &ldquo;Stal, I think we should leave, as I have said.&rdquo; As he spoke, the door behind them&mdash; the great bronze door&mdash; began to spin upon its hinges, dragging heavily upon the ground, scraping against the bronze flooring. Light showered in through the opening gap as the door was slowly being thrust ajar. Though, they noticed, the light had a refracted texture; as though it were being cast through a gem or opalescent structure. The rainbow-dabbled light was cast down and gathered like a puddle of scintillating glow on the bronze floor. Stal and Glason&rsquo;n&rsquo;s faces were limned in a prismatic lustre, which had the various multi-colored shapes dance around their faces in a tremulous rhythm. Stal&rsquo;s face, primarily. The light was reflected from Glason&rsquo;n&rsquo;s iron helmet. Though in through the socket, his eye could be seen to hide a glimmer, breathing the light.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The rapier&hellip; it was&hellip;&rdquo; He ran over to the rapier which had fallen down from the statue. He had not even caught the sound when it had fallen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir Glason&rsquo;n? Do we go in?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be out for very long. Drussock is waiting for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So do we not go in?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, give me a moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n sat down. Checking for his notebook, he noticed he had left it back at the lighthouse. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have my notebook.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you forget it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n did not stand up immediately. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Every time I feel as though I&rsquo;ve touched upon&mdash; or stumbled upon&mdash; something greater, as some arcane heart of hearts, I can&rsquo;t help but feel as though it is the soul of &nbsp;the lighthouse which prevents my total understanding, which drags me back to its iron walls. I can&rsquo;t help but feel as though the Lighthouse is some curse. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But the door is open!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n stood up, looking through toward the room. &ldquo;Then let us take a look.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Walking through, with a creeping walk, they spilled into the chamber, where they noticed the source of the dazzling array of colour; a chandelier swung up above their heads. The chamber was rather small and cramped. It had little room to breathe. It had an octagonal shape, a tall ceiling; each wall had a door&mdash; a great dark wooden door. The floor was chequered and the walls were themselves wrapped in a Victorian wallpaper, reminiscent of a classical floral pattern&mdash; it was a wan yellow in hue. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In Glason&rsquo;n&rsquo;s ears, he could detect a faint &nbsp;tapping at a primaeval rhythm, he could hear the resounding echo of very primitive drums. It was a fuzzy sound, hardly detectable. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stal, can you hear that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hear what, Sir Glason&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n continued circling around the small chamber, dragging his cane behind him. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drums,&rdquo; he whispered, turning to Stal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drums? I don&rsquo;t hear any drums, sorry. Sir Glason&rsquo;n? Glason&rsquo;n are you alright? You&rsquo;ve been out a bit, wouldn&rsquo;t Drussock notice your absence? He&rsquo;s not aware you&rsquo;re this far.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m alright,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But they are close; faint, but close, I can hear them as though they come from within my own skull.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That may be the case&hellip; Sir Glason&rsquo;n, let us head home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, Stallenaire; walk! Walk and I shall be right behind you,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stal stood for a moment, waiting for Glason&rsquo;n to say something more, feeling a bit momentarily dissatisfied by the statement.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, just go you! I&rsquo;ll be right behind, just head outside, up the ladder quickly and leave that flashlight to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why the flashlight, I need to see as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh sure, but I&rsquo;m sure you know your way quite well,&rdquo; he said, with a shrewish smile. &ldquo;Go daddle along!&rdquo; He waved Stal away hurriedly. &ldquo;You know, daddle out, walk away, waddle out of here, I need to see one more thing.&rdquo; He stuck his hand out for the flashlight. Stallenaire left with the flashlight. Glason&rsquo;n looked at him in disbelief. &ldquo;What rotten person you are!&rdquo; He turned back toward the wallpaper. &ldquo;I may get terribly lost, I hope you know! I may die of starvation if I do not make it out properly!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can see perfectly well with the faint light of the chandelier!&rdquo; yelled Stal from across the room as he climbed the ladder. In moments the gleam of the flashlight was gone and up the ladder into the bright of day, which had hardly an effect on the darkness of the larger room, for it was really only a thing shaft of natural light which descended straight downward like an embarassing stream of water.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What luck! I should have not entrusted Stal with such a task. That he&rsquo;d bail on me in such an instant! Could he not have just stayed a little longer&hellip;&rdquo; He turned back to the wallpaper. &ldquo;Yes! That&rsquo;s right. It had a peculiar row going near the bottom!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He crouched down with great difficulty, landing heavily onto his knees. He took a careful long look, seeing&mdash; with some difficulty&mdash; the array of trees which lined the bottom, small illustrations of trees, a marshy green, with various illustrations of rodents, namely rabbits amidst the undergrowth. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, then!&rdquo; He heaved himself up with effort. &ldquo;Not much to note. And those doors,&rdquo; he said, directing his gaze to the doors. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t much to note at the moment either, then. I don&rsquo;t suspect I can simply open them&hellip;&rdquo; Glason&rsquo;n walked toward the doors, each of the eight, attempting to open them, however their knobs would not budge at all. Really, it seemed to him, that the knobs were not really knobs at all. But they were maybe something more&mdash; or less, he thought briefly, given they could simply be a part of the door&rsquo;s structure, not a different mechanical gadget&hellip; in the traditional sense when referring to knobs on doors. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;re still up there, Stal?&rdquo; He walked through the semi-dark large room. He could see the ladder quite evidently illuminated&mdash; there was no need for a flashlight, he thought. So Stallenaire should have&mdash; as any good man would in the face of a man with a cane&mdash; given it to him, no problem.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Well, Stallenaire does seem rather elderly&hellip; I think, I do not really know. He has the ugly appearance of someone who may be elderly. That strange appearance, however he could simply be a poorly aged thirty-year old. Which, of course, was my first thought. Simply, given his story, he really shouldn&rsquo;t be so old.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once up the ladder, he was momentarily blinded by the sunlight which flashed unto his eyes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As Stallenaire suggested, Drussock may be looking for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He began a slow trek along the woods as he remembered them, before spotting that cursed black rabbit once again! </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">What a sight! </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, dear&hellip; dear&hellip; what name did I give that Rabbit?&rdquo; He approached the rabbit with great care at first. It began to flee. &ldquo;Arcks! Arckessat, dear! Don&rsquo;t go, you wretched fool, I mean you no harm!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He chased after the rabbit, feeling himself to run awkwardly, noting that his right leg was beginning to give out on him. But feeling determined, Glason&rsquo;n continued, through thorns and shrubs. &ldquo;Arcks! I need only see you for a moment! I gave you a name, see! But&hellip;&rdquo; he began to talk more quietly, in a mutter. &ldquo;I suppose you can&rsquo;t know that, you low-brained creature, what a shame.&rdquo; He picked up the pace, the rabbit quickened its own, its small feet hardly tapping upon the ground before flying into another stride. Truly it felt as though it were almost in flight.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">I&rsquo;m so near it! I&rsquo;m almost there! This wretched creature can leave once I get there, once I arrive!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;said the rabbit. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n could pick up on the rabbit&rsquo;s&mdash; Arckessat&rsquo;s&mdash; speech, though he was sincerely unsure whether it were his own mind or the rabbit were truly speaking in some manner. It did not move its mouth, nor did its speech really match how breathless the rabbit should have been, given its desperate prancing. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">I must get there, I must get there, </span><span class="c0">continued the Rabbit.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n was hot upon its hind legs, he could smell the Rabbit&rsquo;s matte fur&mdash; wet fur&mdash; a peculiar but pleasant scent; it was an earthy scent, as when autumn rain falls unto virgin soil. Chasing the rabbit, he did not notice the branch above him. He hit the branch with his head. As the iron mask was hit, and in turn hitting firmly against his forehead, he was knocked swiftly unconscious. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chapter Three.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hidden into the dark, verdant undergrowth of the forest, where the whistle of the trees came to a brief lull, he awoke, laid with care against the soil, with tall grass surrounding him, silently moving with the wind. He could hear the sough of the wind and, as his ears were near the ground, the small steps and skitter-scatter of animals along the summer ground. He was laid on his back. He had not his iron helmet, and it was not near him. His cane was missing. His hair was in a mess. He sat up, noticing the many trees around him. He was in a small clearing. It was absent of trees, but the grass did not clear, as it was still long. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s awakened!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been awakened!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Awakened!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Awakened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Master has awoken.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dear, is he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He is not! Leave him be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Father, he is awake! Let us see him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is he so? Let us see&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From where he sat, he could hear the countless whispers of voices, each a unique voice, arguing in meandering manner. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Peculiar creatures&mdash; of small stature, he noticed&mdash; many furry creatures of all ends of life, gathered at the ends of his boots, the cuffs of his sleeves, and his ears. Glason&rsquo;n fell back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bring him to me,&rdquo; says the older voice. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, father!&rdquo; say many young delicate voices together.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, dear father, he is of the heavy kind! He has no fur!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No matter! We could not bear to have such an accident,&rdquo; replies father.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, father!&rdquo; say many young voices in harmony.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n noticed that he was being dragged upon the ground, being lifted up a few centimetres. In fact, he was quite astounded, but maintained his aloof appearance. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What in the stars are you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The voice&mdash; Glason&rsquo;n&mdash; startled the creatures. They dropped him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What a manner of speak,&rdquo; said one, grumpily.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Truly, he has no manners!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Must we </span><span class="c3">really</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;bring the man in?&rdquo; said another.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Yes, father, </span><span class="c3">must </span><span class="c0">we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No bickering! Just follow my lead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They followed the old father&rsquo;s cane, which limned the way through the dark forests. Here, Glason&rsquo;n noticed, the trees were not their usual selves. They did not stand upright and solemnly as they did in other parts of the island. Her the trees bent, as though to each get a full view of the man&mdash; Glason&rsquo;n, he was&mdash; as though they had some silent curiosity. They wrapped over one another, trying to get a sight of the man. Their leaves rustled. The creatures began to pluck at string and harp, blow in horns and whistles as they carried the man to his destination (wherever that may be!).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, the lovely trees!&rdquo; they sang.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, the lovely trees!&rdquo; interrupted another.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They continued. It had a withering tone, though the fervor of some old ballroom music. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Dan-cing down by the dozen;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">A frenzy of dancers, </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">they meet at the Sun!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Coming through waves,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">They tell us&hellip; They tell us&hellip; They tell us!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The little creatures tripped over one another, immersed in song.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Stumbling over the sand,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Our fathers would tell us:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">A hand having been drowned,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">Eternity and life as rivers, </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">They could not be bound!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Oh, stop it! I can carry myself,&rdquo; said Glason&rsquo;n, sitting upright once more. &ldquo;What a rotten crowd of&hellip;&rdquo; He looked toward the creatures as he dusted his coat, and wiped soil off his trousers too. &ldquo;What creatures,&rdquo; he said. They were many small creatures, small furry creatures. They were not peculiar in any sense, not at all. Rather, it was in their mundaneness that he was swept away into a world of some feverish-dream. It </span><span class="c3">must</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have been a dream. For, right before him, there were rodents and mammals of all sorts: mice and rabbits, squirrels, hares. There were, further up ahead, foxes and honeybadgers, and many plenty more. They were utterly mundane in appearance&mdash; really, nothing spectacular. However, it was not the creatures themselves that caused any further surprise&mdash; it was their attire, the fact that they had any at all. They were dressed in classical attire, clothing, capes, coats and all sorts of wear. Some with ties, others with ribbons. They were incredibly adorned as well. With watches and chains, shimmering in gold, monocles, they were a picture of the bourgeoisie&mdash; a quite flattering and fantastical one. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They appeared rather dream-ish and whimsical to Glason&rsquo;n who, to no surprise, found himself in total dismay. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What creatures are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Animals!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A hare!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A fox.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Deletraus, the mouse,&rdquo; said another.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Okay, enough!&rdquo; said Glason&rsquo;n. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t demand to know your names or your species. My questi&mdash; regardless, I can see that for myself. That question was completely rhetorical. What a bunch of&hellip; what an </span><span class="c3">idiotic</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;bunch, of course, if you could not catch that. Of course&hellip;&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suspect I should expect more from animals. Especially such lowly mammals as you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said many.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What have we said, Father!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This man has no manners!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Forget it, all of you!&rdquo; It was an old fox which spoke the word. Father, they called him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He wore a bowler&rsquo;s cap, with a cape over his fur. He had leather booties at his paws, and an umbrella&mdash; Glason&rsquo;n wondered at this&mdash; slung upon his waist (wherever one could decide that may be on a fox). The fox was not a vibrant autumnal colour, but was faded and desaturated. It was more a greyish-brown, with some tawny underhue.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir. Sir?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir Glason&rsquo;n. Glason&rsquo;n is my name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir Glason&rsquo;n, why don&rsquo;t you stay with us. I assure you that you will feel relieved to stay with us, and regretful if you leave now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Such a ridiculous notion! If I am to stay, it would be because I chose to, not because of these empty words of yours!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;However best suits you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Though, I am famished! I may stay&hellip; How long have I been unconscious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That we don&rsquo;t entirely know. No more than twelve hours, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Twelve!&rdquo; he repeated in disbelief. &ldquo;Twelve, you tell me? You say it as though it were only mere minutes&hellip;!&rdquo; He stood up, before crouching back down to meet the fox&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Twelve hours is no play, I must let you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Oh, sir&mdash; Glason&rsquo;n Sir&mdash; that truly does not matter. It is night! The night is bright&mdash; see only the stars&hellip; they are like a mother&rsquo;s milk, dappled throughout the sky, shining brightly. The night is fertile&mdash; the night is </span><span class="c3">white</span><span class="c0">! Man&mdash; excluding you&mdash; is asleep! Accompany us to the Red Festival.&rdquo; The Father Fox continued further down the damp soil, where green leaves shimmered, buried into their depths, and beautiful green plants and pinecones scattered the edges of the path like grand balustrades leading up a stairway. &ldquo;The Festival occurs only once a month, and it is a great celebration! This month, it is especially great and uniquely divine. The moon shall shine above us at its fullest!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n looked above him. The moon was full; swelling in white.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, it seems that way,&rdquo; said Glason&rsquo;n.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, don&#39;t be such a gloom, Sir Glason&rsquo;n.&rdquo; The Father&rsquo;s voice did seem very old and wavering in strength. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I am </span><span class="c3">not</span><span class="c6">,&rdquo; said Glason&rsquo;n to himself. But he found no reason to reject the Father Fox&rsquo;s offer; he followed the fox. &ldquo;What strange animals!&rdquo; he repeated to himself. It was all he could do; struck in such disbelief at such strange attire upon the animals&mdash; wintry attire, no less&mdash; the repetition kept him somewhat sane. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; continued Glason&rsquo;n, stumbling through the ground littered with flora and acorns and fruits that fell from above. &ldquo;Do </span><span class="c3">you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have any sense of when summer shall be over?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fox turned to Glason&rsquo;n. &ldquo;Summer? Summer?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Summer?&rdquo; said the others.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why, he says summer!&rdquo; said one. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Summer, surely he jests!&rdquo; said one mouse.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look at that gloom upon his face, he may be indeed very serious, let us not mock him!&rdquo; said a squirrel.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He may have been knocked unconscious for more than simply a few hours,&rdquo; joked a pale hare, dressed in a very thick, brumal Victorian coat, with a watch dangling from his neck, his tie neatly tucked in.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n looked with annoyance to the creatures prancing around his feet. He kicked the squirrel.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Summer? Sir, summer has been very much quite over for some time now. See only around you. The tide falls low, and the frost nips at the pinecones and tree&rsquo;s bark. Surely, you notice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n did not notice. But looking, he saw the frost rime his boots and clothes, hanging onto threads of fabric, snowflakes falling lightly upon his hair and nose&mdash; his nose was a bright red, and his ears were flushed too. He had not his iron helmet. His skin touched the frigid air, and felt a sort of warm-rush embrace. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&mdash;see. I see, winter is here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes it is, Glason&rsquo;n, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;But then truly, </span><span class="c3">really</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;this must be a dream of some sort. I may have struck my head too hard, and fallen into such a trance as this.&rdquo; The others could not hear his quiet murmur to himself. &ldquo;But, then. If I am so aware, I must have total autonomy here. I should wake up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However he tried to close his eyes and focus, he could not wake himself up. He did, however, (as his eyes were closed) trip against a root and fall. He was not thrown unconscious. Nonetheless, it would be impossible to say it did not hurt, for it very much did. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Quite clumsy you are, Sir Glason&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said the squirrel.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Leave me alone!&rdquo; said Glason&rsquo;n.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He saw the countless creatures. Ten of him, or eleven. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Give me your names, since I am stuck with you all. I suppose I should acquaint myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Artiean.&rdquo; said the squirrel.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Frossien,&rdquo; said the mouse.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Klaukel,&rdquo; said the honeybadger.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Plennail,&rdquo; said the pale hare.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sielle,&rdquo; said the lovely bird&mdash; a hummingbird?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lelta,&rdquo; said the gopher.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And Otolare,&rdquo; said the porcupine.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Clea,&rdquo; said a timid cat (who hid behind a nearby tree).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elusen,&rdquo; said the bat.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And Arckessat,&rdquo; said the black rabbit.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And Father Fox,&rdquo; they all said. Father Fox stood in quiet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, all great names,&rdquo; said Glason&rsquo;n. &ldquo;Are we near your homes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
