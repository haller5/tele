</head><body class="c6 doc-content"><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I do too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;And do tell that girl I said hello.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, mom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With his large brumal coat which fit him rather too largely, his gloves that fit like knights&rsquo; gauntlets, and a great bag slung across his back, he walked out the small home. It was the middle of winter, the early months of the year&mdash; the early days of January. His boots sinked deeply into the white powderous snow. They threw up white grains of snow as he walked, and small specks of opalescent ice were cast onto the fronts of his soles. Looking down, he saw them glow subtly in all colours, reflecting the early morning Sun which, behind thick white clouds, was blindingly bright. Looking at the snow before him, in the large empty expanse, the white fields were garishly luminous. The fields were not empty, however. They had no other homes near. But there was a great many arrays of strawberry fields, arranged horizontally, covered in white. The plants were dead, and obscured in dazzling hoarfrost. They looked like elegant balustrades of ice flowing down the hills. Scarce shafts of sunlight lightly limned their surfaces. Nearing them, he looked behind them. He left profound, small prints. At the very end of the strawberry fields, through which he held his arm low to slide it along the frosted plants, he met with the young girl. They were both young, not yet matured into adolescence though just hardly beginning to bloom. The boy had his childish look and so did the girl, though she had begun to develop some silhouette of adolescent hips. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You have no cap!&rdquo; shouted the girl, she was still many metres away, and with the early morning fog, only her grey figure was visible. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I do!&rdquo; he shouted back. He reached deeply into his coat pocket, on his right, pulling out a beige winter cap, terribly worn. He placed it firmly upon his head, his dark hair poking out the sides, unkempt and ungroomed. The cap had a large, wide bill and had on the sides large fur-lined flaps which embraced his ears. The bill was awfully torn, exposing the inner canvas, and the crown of the hat was covered in patched fabric. As he approached, he noticed the girl in full. She wore a nice winter cap of her own, though the build resembled that of the cap of a military officer, flat on the top with a small curved bill across the front. It was a dark navy colour, or black. It was speckled with snow, as were her full attire. She wore a beautifully adorned off-white dress, spotted with flowers, beneath her coat, which was far too large for herself. It was a men&rsquo;s coat. Hardly did her pale blue-hued fingers poke out of the great sleeves. She wore some old mahogany-coloured military boots. They were untied. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the bag?&rdquo; she asks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He moved closer, he smiled. The snow, though calm in the mornings, was being swayed quickly in the wind, as it swirled about them, falling lightly on their red noses and their eyelashes and eyebrows, nearly covered in white.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I sewed you a scarf.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A scarf?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied timidly. &ldquo;I finished it only yesterday, I know it&rsquo;s already the very midst of winter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry, let me see it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He slung his bag to his chest, and he unbuttoned it to pull out the scarf. It was a long, thick and grand scarf. He had sewn many snowflake designs into it. It was a dark blue colour. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very good at the designs, as you can see I made a mistake here.&rdquo; He looked at her, his eyes glinting. He held the scarf tightly, not daring to drop it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t you stop? It looks perfect. What mistake?&rdquo; She took it from his hands. He stared at her, his hands still in place, as though the scarf still wrapped his palms. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One snowflake did look off to the rest. She put it on, wrapping it around her reddish, cold neck. It was embraced in its warmth. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a large manor not far from here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No there is not!&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is being built not far from here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From afar they appeared like ants crawling up the snowy hills. They were surrounded by nothing but great misty fog up on the hills. But beneath the fog, sleepy in the dew of early wintry mornings, there was a large sprawling village of many old wooden homes. Their snow gabled roofs shimmered in the sunlight, their windows cast in frost, and their doors adorned with snowflakes. Snow piled up on their sides, in many coats. From down below, looking up at the hill, the lonely wooden house of the boy, and the elegant display of frost-coated rows of strawberry plants, hibernating in snowy slumber, there was a grand sense of nausea and disbelonging. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They left many small tracks beneath them. After nearly an hour, he recalled what his mother had told him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My mom told me to tell you she said hello.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice. Tell her I say hello, too.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t turn back to face him. Her face was shaded in many red, mottled hues, where blood gathered beneath her skin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The boy looked forward. There was a large set of rudimentary wooden pillars and many great rows of material beside it. The silhouette, obscured by some fog, certainly resembled a large home. Many figures were seen gathered around&mdash; workers. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They sat down in the snow, watching the workers move at fleeting speeds across the manor. Elevating this pillar and removing that one. They sat in silence for half an hour, watching them work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; she replied quietly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you do at home for fun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;For fun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I paint, sometimes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Paint?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I like to write.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Poems?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you have anything?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, I always carry my note book.&rdquo; He reached into his large bag.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Opening to the middle, where a bookmark&mdash; a feather&mdash; was left, he began to read.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It had struck midnight when I arrived. The streets had left ghosts of people, and their silvery, translucent after-images. The countless blazing, electric lights had hurt my eyes. I returned home to my wooden house; I wish I had not visited.&rdquo; He turned to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That was beautifully written.&rdquo; She furrowed her brow. &ldquo;But what does it mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&#39;t?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I just write what I feel. I don&rsquo;t know what I feel.&rdquo; He slid the book back in the bag. He looked back at the manor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting cold.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They went back home. He invited her in for some chocolate, seeing as it was still late morning. </span></p></body></html>
